To this extent , Marxism 's universalizing narrative of the unfolding of a rational system of world history is simply a negative form of the history of European imperialism : it was Hegel , after all , who declared that ‘ Africa has no history ’ , and it was Marx who , though critical of British imperialism , concluded that the British colonization of India was ultimately for the best because it brought India into the evolutionary narrative of Western history , thus creating the conditions for future class struggle there .

If it enabled the latter the crucial theoretical move of being able to reject the classical empiricist conception of knowledge , it was also to put him in the position of even castigating as ‘ historicist ’ any attempts to account for theoretical discourse in terms of its historical conditions of production — perhaps one of the major ways in which he differed from Canguilhem and Foucault .

If his notion of the mode of production as such a totality could not be sustained in a differential relation to other modes of production ( notions of residual and emergent forms notwithstanding ) , Althusser nevertheless offered a particularly interesting theorization of the problems involved in the concept of the historical , articulating the paradoxical conditions of any theorization of history .

But whereas Althusser followed Bachelard 's and Cavaillès ' preoccupation with the formal systems of the pure sciences and set theory , Foucault rather pursued Canguilhem 's focus on the medical and biological sciences , which emphasized their cultural frame and the historical and institutional ( both discursive and non-discursive ) conditions of their emergence which , according to Canguilhem , ‘ chronicle-history ’ neglected .

As for the origin of species , reflection on many palaeontological and biogeographical facts , including those established by the expert judgments of Richard Owen and John Gould on the voyage material , had convinced Darwin , by early spring 1837 , that the close similarity seen between any congeneric endemic species in two areas was not always explicable as a common adaptation to common conditions ; for often the two sets of species were endemic in areas with very different climate , soil and so on .

The definitional question , of what natural selection is , can be answered by specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for its occurrence , namely hereditary variation that is causally relevant to reproductive success thanks to organism-environment interactions ; it can , then , be answered without begging in advance of empirical inquiry all those further questions as to whether these conditions are ever met : whether , that is , any natural selection exists ; and , if so , how it is distributed , what it can do now and what it has been responsible for in the past .

Conditions then vary from those in which the cultural institutions and their producers are wholly subordinated to general state policy — a condition often made harsher by full or attempted monopoly of all means of cultural production — to more nuanced situations in which , while general policy direction is exercised , the practical relations are not significantly different from those in modern patronal and intermediate bodies , which of course also , in varying ways , have general policy directions in accordance with the social order in which they are working .

The generally-accepted explanation for welfare payment levels in the South is that they are , and have been , low because of : the relative poverty of the southern States , which would call for a high fiscal effort if payments equivalent to those made further north were to be offered to the larger number of poor there ; the electoral safety of the Democratic party with regard to the southern State legislatures and governorships , for over a century — sustained by discriminatory practices which prevented many blacks becoming registered voters despite their legal achievement of civil rights ; and the widespread belief among southern whites in the racial inferiority of blacks — who are the main recipients of welfare benefits coupled with the perceived work-disincentive effects of substantial payments and the encouragement to have even larger , and thus more dependent , families than they are believed to provide . But why have these three conditions arisen ?

Another way of putting this is that Adorno analyses — with great insight — the conditions of a specific mode of musical autonomy but then makes the mistake of reading what is a qualitative change , a historical variant , as an epistemological category ; the truth-content of music is seen as directly related to its degree of autonomy of this kind .

Hume 's argument , however , does not hold water for the simple reason that it assumes that the question of the possibility of significantly ascribing identity to objects as ontological existents can and should be decided via an analysis of the conditions of their identification , whereas the simple fact is that the concept of an entity as a potential topic of discourse is analytically linked with , and hence inseparable from , that of identity .

To put it differently , if spatiotemporal relations are to be appealed to in support of the thesis that there can be numerically , not just qualitatively , distinguishable ontological existents , it is necessary , in the first place , to clarify the conditions under which such relations can be significantly claimed to reflect the structure of an objective world , and in trying to do so we are likely to find that in some form or other we need to assume what such relations are supposed to explain .

For , if one accepts a truth-conditional semantics then one is forced to state truth conditions on sentences-in-contexts , or if one prefers ( as Katz would ) that semantics is concerned with aspects of meaning assigned by convention to linguistic forms , then one includes context-dependent aspects of meaning within semantics .

Further , such a view provides a nice parallel with semantics : for just as a semantic theory is concerned , say , with the recursive assignment of truth conditions to well-formed formulae , so pragmatics is concerned with the recursive assignment of appropriateness conditions to the same set of sentences with their semantic interpretations In other words , a pragmatic theory should in principle predict for each and every well-formed sentence of a language , on a particular semantic reading , the set of contexts in which it would be appropriate .

So suppose we attempt , for example , to phrase accounts of the pragmatic notion of presupposition in terms of appropriateness conditions , we shall find that they wrongly predict conditions of usage .

For example , we have already noted the argument ( and see Chapter 2 below ) that if semantics is to be truth-conditional , then the truth conditions can only be assigned to utterances , not sentences — in other words , contextual specifications are a necessary input to a semantic component , and thus pragmatics is ( at least in this respect ) 16 prior to semantics .

On the one hand , various syntactic rules seem to be properly constrained only if one refers to pragmatic conditions ; and similarly for matters of stress and intonation .

Suppose we identify the semantic content of a sentence with its truth conditions , then the semantic content of ( 4 ) Letizia de Ramolino was the mother of Napoleon will amount to a specification of the circumstances under which it would be true , namely that the individual known as Letizia de Ramolino was in fact identical to the individual who was the mother of Napoleon .

As we saw in section 2.1 , we can not state the truth conditions of sentences with indexicals without reference to the deictic function of indexicals ; but if we allow truth conditions to be relativized to speakers , addressees , times , places , indicated objects , etc .

There are , though , many obstacles to the accommodation of deixis within semantics by simply providing a list of indices or contextual points of reference relative to which truth conditions can be stated .

This deserves special mention because , on the assumption that various conditions which appear to be satisfied by the return maps are actually satisfied , this attractor is probably the only well understood strange attractor known in a system of `` natural `` three-dimensional differential equations ; we have strong reasons to suppose that there can be no stable orbits in a relatively large parameter range , as opposed to the normal `` chaotic attractors where one merely can not observe them but has no arguments to suggest they can not exist ( they may be of extremely high period or have very complicated basins of attraction see { 8 } ) .

Where a possession order is made in respect of a " regulated tenancy " of residential property in a discretionary case ( Cases 1 – 10 ) , the court may stay or suspend execution , or postpone the date of possession for such periods as it thinks fit but it must ( unless there is exceptional hardship ) impose conditions as to payment of rent ( or mesne profits ) and arrears : s 100 of the Rent Act 1977 ; s 75(1) — ( 3 ) of the Housing Act 1980 .

The conclusions seem to be that printing in general is fatal , draft standard conditions sent for negotiation are very often caught , but there is not a problem with the unique situation , or one where there is genuine negotiation — even if the starting point is a set of standard terms and conditions .

This exercise is valuable not only to enable the draftsman to produce a set of conditions which is most to the advantage of his client ( whether his client be buyer or seller ) , but also to enable him to understand the motivation of the other side when he is in negotiation with their advisers .

The use of standard conditions gives rise to two special problems under the common law .
the use of standard [rules] gives rise to two special problems under the common law .

The first relates to whether a set of standard conditions should govern the contract in the first place , and the second ( in the case where the parties exchange their respective sets of standard conditions ) to the question of which set shall govern the contract between the parties ( the so-called `` battle of the forms `` ) .

2.2 Incorporation of standard conditions in the contract
2.2 incorporation of standard [rules] in the contract

The special issues in the ticket cases revolve around whether the party whom it is sought to bind under the conditions on the ticket had actual or constructive knowledge of their existence .
the special issues in the ticket cases revolve around whether the party whom it is sought to bind under the [rules] on the ticket had actual or constructive knowledge of their existence .

The question of constructive knowledge is dealt with in part by asking whether or not , in the circumstances of the particular case , the ticket was the sort of document on which one would reasonably expect to find legally binding terms and conditions , and in part by asking whether or not the party issuing the ticket made reasonable attempts to bring the existence of the conditions to the notice of the other party .
the question of constructive knowledge is dealt with in part by asking whether or not , in the circumstances of the particular case , the ticket was the sort of document on which one would reasonably expect to find legally binding terms and [rules] , and in part by asking whether or not the party issuing the ticket made reasonable attempts to bring the existence of the [rules] to the notice of the other party .

The first relevant principle to be derived from the ticket cases in the case of contracts placed on standard terms and conditions is that , if the party whom it is sought to bind knows that there is a set of standard terms which the other party intends should apply to the contract , and he enters into the contract on this basis , he will be bound by them .

On the principles relating to constructive knowledge in the ticket cases , the documents upon which standard terms and conditions are usually printed ( quotations , order forms and acknowledgments ) are clearly the sort of document where one would expect to find terms and conditions , and which a reasonable man would read carefully .
on the principles relating to constructive knowledge in the ticket cases , the documents upon which standard terms and [rules] are usually printed ( quotations , order forms and acknowledgments ) are clearly the sort of document where one would expect to find terms and [rules] , and which a reasonable man would read carefully .

Thus , prima facie , the party who receives such a document should be bound by relevant standard terms and conditions , even if he never reads the document , and is unaware that they exist .

here they rely on the principles in the ticket cases which require a reasonable attempt to give notice to a party of the existence of terms and [rules] by which it is intended to bind him .

It is hard to see why reasonable notice should be an additional requirement where the document concerned is one which a reasonable man would regard as a legal document , to be read carefully for its terms and conditions .

For this reason , all documents which have standard terms and conditions on the reverse should have a clear statement on the front to the effect that the contract is to be subject to the terms and conditions on the reverse .

Where conditions are incorporated by reference it is also prudent and , according to some authorities , necessary , to offer to the party whom it is sought to bind by them a reasonable opportunity for inspection ( see Parker v South Eastern Railway , above ) .
where [rules] are incorporated by reference it is also prudent and , according to some authorities , necessary , to offer to the party whom it is sought to bind by them a reasonable opportunity for inspection ( see parker v south eastern railway , above ) .

Finally , as a preliminary issue , it is important to establish that actual or constructive knowledge of the relevant conditions occurred before the contract concerned came into existence .

The problems associated with the battle of the forms arise because the common law principles governing the formation of contracts are based on the concept of a bargain arrived at through a process of negotiation , while the whole purpose of standard conditions is to minimise or exclude the process of negotiation .

The first step is for the seller to send out a quotation , on the back of which will be printed his standard conditions of sale .
the first step is for the seller to send out a quotation , on the back of which will be printed his standard [rules] of sale .

The quotation will state that any contract entered into as a result of the quotation will be on these standard conditions of sale , to the entire exclusion of those of the buyer ( see the preliminary statement of Precedent 1 ) .
the quotation will state that any contract entered into as a result of the quotation will be on these standard [rules] of sale , to the entire exclusion of those of the buyer ( see the preliminary statement of precedent 1 ) .

Whether the quotation be an invitation to treat or an offer is actually immaterial , because the buyer will in response send back his purchase order with his standard conditions of purchase on the back .
whether the quotation be an invitation to treat or an offer is actually immaterial , because the buyer will in response send back his purchase order with his standard [rules] of purchase on the back .

This is because in the purchase conditions there will be a provision stating that any contract entered into pursuant to the purchase order will be on the standard conditions of purchase on the back of the order ( see the preliminary statement and cl 1.1 of Precedent 2 ) .
this is because in the purchase [rules] there will be a provision stating that any contract entered into pursuant to the purchase order will be on the standard [rules] of purchase on the back of the order ( see the preliminary statement and cl 1.1 of precedent 2 ) .

This contradicts the requirement on the quotation that the contract be on the standard conditions of the seller .
this contradicts the requirement on the quotation that the contract be on the standard [rules] of the seller .

If the order acknowledgement contains no reference to the standard conditions on the back of the quotation , the acknowledgement will become the unconditional acceptance needed to create the contract .
if the order acknowledgement contains no reference to the standard [rules] on the back of the quotation , the acknowledgement will become the unconditional acceptance needed to create the contract .

In this case , contrary to the wishes of the seller , the buyer 's conditions will govern the contract , because the seller has , in effect , accepted the counter-offer of the buyer , contained in the purchase order , to do business on the buyer 's conditions .
in this case , contrary to the wishes of the seller , the buyer 's [rules] will govern the contract , because the seller has , in effect , accepted the counter-offer of the buyer , contained in the purchase order , to do business on the buyer 's [rules] .

In fact the acknowledgement in most cases either has the seller 's conditions printed on the back , or refers to the execution of the contract in accordance with the quotation in such a way that the seller 's conditions on the back of the quotation are incorporated by reference .
in fact the acknowledgement in most cases either has the seller 's [rules] printed on the back , or refers to the execution of the contract in accordance with the quotation in such a way that the seller 's [rules] on the back of the quotation are incorporated by reference .

However , if the seller 's acknowledgement was a counter-offer , the buyer 's acknowledgment will , again , either be an unconditional acceptance ( ie no further reference to the buyer 's standard conditions ) , or a further counter-offer .

The court held that the covering letter had not made it clear that the seller was intending to contract on his own terms and conditions , and that he had merely mentioned the offer by way of reference for its main terms ( eg quoted price and delivery ) .

Thus the seller 's return of the signed copy order , containing the buyer 's terms and conditions , was an unconditional acceptance , and the contract came into existence on the buyer 's terms and conditions .
thus the seller 's return of the signed copy order , containing the buyer 's terms and [rules] , was an unconditional acceptance , and the contract came into existence on the buyer 's terms and [rules] .

On this analysis the contract will always be governed by the standard conditions attached to the last genuine counter-offer to pass between the parties , although ( as seen from Butler ) this may not actually be the last document to pass between the parties .

The seller is then likely specifically to reject the buyer 's acknowledgement , and a detailed negotiation as to whose conditions are to govern the contract will probably ensue .

This defeats the purpose of doing business on standard conditions ( speed and efficiency in dealing with a large number of transactions ) , and the purchasing departments of both the buyer and the seller will probably be unable to cope with the work load imposed if there are many such special negotiations .

Under these circumstances , unless the seller 's own acknowledgement was poorly drafted ( as was the case in Butler ) , without a special negotiation it was almost impossible to decide in individual cases which set of conditions prevailed .

Another view of some civil law courts is that neither set of conditions can apply to the contract ( since the parties manifestly wanted the contract to exist , acted as if it did , but could not agree as to which of their sets of standard conditions should apply to it ) .

in addition to the problems raised by the battle of the forms , there is the need to consider the relationship between prime contract [rules] and subcontract [rules] .

The buyer 's greatest exposure will come not so much from the fact that he has accepted the seller 's standard conditions as governing the contract between them , but from situations where there is a mismatch between the obligations undertaken by the seller in favour of the buyer under the subcontract , and the obligations undertaken by the buyer to his customer under the prime contract .

The buyer naturally has the opposite concern and , in the absence of a formal back to back contract , when one is dealing with standard conditions of purchase the best that can be accomplished is to incorporate a provision like cl 1.3 of Precedent 2 , which notifies the seller of the possibility of prime contracts , and attempts to impose their terms upon the seller , coupled with an opportunity for the seller to examine them and a warning that they will apply , even if not examined .

The exclusion of liability for all of these issues can be dealt with either on a piecemeal basis by writing a particular exclusion or limitation into the contract conditions dealing with each issue , or , alternatively or in addition , by the use of blanket exclusion clauses covering the whole contract .

Where the parties have a continuing relationship based on a large volume of business under regular orders the most efficient way to proceed is to enter into a framework agreement which regulates the mechanism for placing orders and decides in advance the terms and conditions which will govern each order .

Earlier in his essay on the rule of law Oakeshott had suggested that to deliberate the jus of lex is ‘ to invoke a particular kind of moral consideration : … the negative and limited consideration that the prescriptions of law should not conflict with a prevailing educated moral sensibility capable of distinguishing between the conditions of ‘ virtue ’ , the conditions of moral association ( ’ good conduct ’ ) , and those which are of such a kind that they should be imposed by law ( ’ justice ’ ) ' .

However , once this is conceded the basis of Oakeshott 's theory is challenged since he views these two forms of association as categorially distinct moral conditions and as shaping two wholly different manners of government and two profoundly different characters of human identity .

How can the Prime Minister claim to be seeking the best deal for Britain when he is determined to get the worst conditions for British workers ?

In the industrial type of society there is , according to Spencer , a tendency for central regulation and coercive control to decline and to be replaced by representative institutions and a more diffuse system of regulation ; but this view is then qualified in various ways , and Spencer finally concludes that representative government depends largely upon the existence of a particular type of economy the laissez-faire free-enterprise economy — which creates the conditions in which ‘ multitudinous objects are achieved by spontaneously evolved combinations of citizens governed representatively ’ .

From a non-evolutionist standpoint , however , the problems that can be posed concerning the state , within a Marxist conception , are limited to the following : the formation of the state as a consequence of a structural transformation of primitive communal societies ( so far as these can be properly located and studied ) ; the types of state which correspond with determinate , historically realized , modes of production , and the conditions which produce a transition from one type to another ; and in the case of capitalist society , the structural characteristics , including the contradictions , which may effect a transition to another ( unknown ) type of society .

Marx 's and Engels 's materialism is thus not the denial of the importance of ideas , concepts , and values for people , like the materialism of Feuerbach , but an assertion that ideas ultimately have a material origin in the real conditions of existence , a history which consists in a complicated interplay and conflict of different factors , some directly material , some mental ( though material in origin ) .
