An important part of the discussion deals with the difficulty of deciding whether variation can be said to be between semantically equivalent forms which carry social meaning , or to encode an aspectual distinction ; this latter issue is treated in the context of a ( non-quantitative ) analysis of the semantic distinctions underlying tense and aspect marking ( see further 7.6 and 7.7 ) .

While a major contribution of this work was to show that apparently meaningless differences in form were in fact carriers of social and stylistic meaning , the 1983 paper attempts on the other hand to demonstrate that forms which are referentially equivalent carry neither social nor stylistic meaning , but are constrained almost entirely by their syntactic environment .

But in her earlier study where she had viewed the alternants as being ‘ equivalent ways of saying the same thing ’ she did not attempt to ‘ account for the interplay between the differences in modal meaning and the social conditioning in the use of these forms ’ ( Lavandera 1982 : 90 — her translation ) .

The generally-accepted explanation for welfare payment levels in the South is that they are , and have been , low because of : the relative poverty of the southern States , which would call for a high fiscal effort if payments equivalent to those made further north were to be offered to the larger number of poor there ; the electoral safety of the Democratic party with regard to the southern State legislatures and governorships , for over a century — sustained by discriminatory practices which prevented many blacks becoming registered voters despite their legal achievement of civil rights ; and the widespread belief among southern whites in the racial inferiority of blacks — who are the main recipients of welfare benefits coupled with the perceived work-disincentive effects of substantial payments and the encouragement to have even larger , and thus more dependent , families than they are believed to provide . But why have these three conditions arisen ?

4.6 There is ample further evidence for regarding the second and third elements in such sequences — unlike the others we have seen so far — as jointly equivalent to a clause at the intensional level ; let us consider the four points which follow : First , most or all such phrases accept the insertion of the explicit predicator to be in front of the adjective ( and to be seems to be more or less obligatory when such adjectives are questioned ) ; we have already seen examples ( e.g. ( 35 ) , ( 41 ) ) .

Second , if we accept that such adjectives , unlike predicate qualifiers , are genuinely equivalent to a modified clause in conjunction with the noun phrase which they follow , then it is entirely predictable that this construction will demand , as the preceding main verb , one which customarily supports a predication expressed in an explicit subordinate clause ; this will not , however , be demanded of the verb preceding a predicate qualifier .

How the surpluses are used has long-term implications for federal government saving , national saving , and ultimately the nation 's future living standards.9 To get a sense of the long-term implications of broad fiscal policy choices , we examined the fiscal and economic outlook over the next 75 years under two alternatives : ( 1 ) assuming that the federal government saves only the Social Security surpluses and ( 2 ) assuming that the federal government saves the entire unified surpluses.10 For simplicity , these fiscal policy simulations assume that saving by households , businesses , and state and local governments remains constant as a share of GDP and that the surpluses saved are used to reduce debt held by the public.11 Once debt held by the public is eliminated , these simulations assume excess cash is used to acquire an unspecified mix of nonfederal assets with a rate of return equivalent to the average interest rate on Treasury securities.12 9Federal Budget : The President 's Midsession Review ( GAO/OCG-99-29 , July 21 , 1999 ) .
how the surpluses are used has long-term implications for federal government saving , national saving , and ultimately the nation 's future living standards.9 to get a sense of the long-term implications of broad fiscal policy choices , we examined the fiscal and economic outlook over the next 75 years under two alternatives : ( 1 ) assuming that the federal government saves only the social security surpluses and ( 2 ) assuming that the federal government saves the entire unified surpluses.10 for simplicity , these fiscal policy simulations assume that saving by households , businesses , and state and local governments remains constant as a share of gdp and that the surpluses saved are used to reduce debt held by the public.11 once debt held by the public is eliminated , these simulations assume excess cash is used to acquire an unspecified mix of nonfederal assets with a rate of return [the same/equal] to the average interest rate on treasury securities.12 9federal budget : the president 's midsession review ( gao/ocg-99-29 , july 21 , 1999 ) .
