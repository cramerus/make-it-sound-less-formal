Thus , to grasp properly the significance of popular dancing in the mid-nineteenth century — the waltz , for example — it is necessary to look not only at the waltz culture of the popular classes but also at such factors as : the peasant sources of the waltz ; the use made of those sources in bourgeois culture ; the changing social relations involved in the growth of industrial capitalism , to which the romanticizing of popular culture found in bourgeois waltzing , together with its cultivation of an explicit sensuality , was probably a reaction ; the tendency of the social developments to result in the atomization of established collective social patterns and modes of corporeal expression , leading , among avant-garde composers , to a music more overtly of thought and feeling , as against a music of social gesture ; the way these same composers , by way of reaction to that situation , incorporated spiritualized versions of dance elements in their music .

Demands for greater ‘ freedom ’ and ‘ authenticity ’ can often be channelled into established stereotypes of rebellion and expression , and thus articulated to the framework of the dominant musical ideology , mediated by a discourse which is organized round notions of ‘ youth ’ , ‘ modernity ’ and ‘ pleasure ’ ; the result can be used across the age-range and across classes , securing the interests of cultural reproduction and of liberal tolerance .

The case for the established electoral system
the case for the [start/begin/form] electoral system

Under the established system for electing members to the House of Commons , each elector has only one vote in a general election ; each constituency returns only one Member of Parliament ; and Members of the House of Commons are elected on a first-past-the-post ( winner takes all ) system whereby the candidate with the most votes wins the seat whether or not he or she has an overall majority of all the votes cast in the constituency .

It is recognised that the established electoral system does discriminate against third parties securing seats in proportion to votes , but this is defended because of the virtues that are seen as flowing from the fact that the system helps to ensure that just one party has a secure majority in the Commons and is therefore able to form a government without the need for coalition .

As regards the political system established in Western Europe , based on representative political institutions — parliament , political and philosophical pluralism , the theory of the separation of powers , decentralization , human rights , etc. — that system is in essentials valid and it will be still more effective with a socialist , and not a capitalist , economic foundation .

Since the 1960s , when a number of new social movements — among them the student movement , various national and ethnic movements , and the women 's movement — became extremely active in political life , a great deal more attention has been given by sociologists to such forms of political action , which may be seen not only as constituting a basis or context for the development of more highly organized political activities , but also as political forces in their own right , existing alongside and sometimes in conflict with , established parties and pressure groups .

Having established a distinction between social movements and organized political formations , and indicated in a preliminary way the characteristics of social movements , it would not be too difficult to construct a typology of such movements , as a number of writers have attempted , in terms of their size ( number of participants ) , range ( local , national , international ) , duration , objectives ( specific or general , directed toward transforming individuals or supra-individual systems ) and so on .

While many of those who were active in the social movements of the 1960s were distrustful of parties , and in some cases viewed society — an ideal society — as an unending process of imaginative creative activity , without any permanently established institutions , those who were deeply engaged in party politics were often inclined to regard the movements as merely disruptive and irresponsible .

From this perspective , electoral politics were only one aspect of the struggle , and the parliamentary leaders were considered subordinate to the leadership of the mass party , which was at the same time the leadership of the class itself Conservative and liberal parties , however much they in fact represented class interests , saw themselves as parties functioning within an established social order and a system of political institutions in which parliament was supreme .

Something of the kind seems to have happened in the case of the European communist parties ; thus Santiago Carrillo ( 1977 ) , in the passage quoted earlier , says plainly that ‘ the political system established in Western Europe … is in essentials valid ’ , and this is far removed from the outlook of some earlier Marxists — and of the members of a few left-wing groupuscules even today — who talk about ‘ smashing the bourgeois state ’ .

Thus two-party systems in the twentieth century became established where there was a clear division between two major classes ( Britain providing a good example ) , whereas systems with several parties have emerged in conditions where such class divisions were complicated by religious differences , by the existence of a significantly large peasantry , by divisions in the working-class movement between socialist and communist parties , and by a variety of other cultural factors and historical legacies .

Such conceptions , however , persistently disregard one of the principal elements in political life , namely , the struggles that have taken place , and still take place , precisely over the ‘ legitimacy ’ of any established system of political power , and over the exclusion of some members of society — frequently a majority of the population — from any effective participation in the determination of collective goals ( which are often in fact , as Marx observed , representations of an illusory , spurious ‘ general interest ’ ) , whether by a restriction of political rights ( for example , the right to vote ) , by coercion or by ideological manipulation .

In its beginnings , therefore , modern nationalism can be seen as one aspect of a class movement which found political expression in a general struggle for democracy ; manifesting itself most clearly in the American Revolution — interpreted by some scholars as the formation of the ‘ first new nation ’ ( Lipset , 1967 ) — and in the French Revolution , which together established the model of a new kind of political system embodying the ideas of ‘ citizenship ’ and ‘ popular sovereignty ’ .

Hence , there is little that is surprising , in my view , in the fact that when movements for popular sovereignty and democracy began to develop on a large scale among colonial and dependent peoples , in the course of the twentieth century , they should have taken as their political model the established nation states , and have become strongly infused with nationalism .

Much of the criticism , however , is directed against the nationalism of the developing countries — against Arab , African or Latin American nationalism , for example — which challenges in various ways the dominance of the industrial capitalist nations ; yet it is evident that nationalism is just as strong in the latter countries , though for good historical reasons ( they are long established , accepted nation states ) it may be less vehemently expressed .

The establishment of such a correlation is not as easy as it might seem at first , because lead is only one ( and probably not one of the more important ) influences on the behaviour and intelligence of children , so that the correlation would at best be low , and hence require a large number of cases to be established at an acceptable level of statistical significance .
