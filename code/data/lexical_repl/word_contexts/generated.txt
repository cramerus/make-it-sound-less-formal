No two coalfields were the same , but if a general pattern can be discerned from the variety of experience it is that during the first half of the nineteenth century each region largely generated its own workforce from the natural increase of its population , but that the spectacular later developments drew not only upon local men who left the farms or rural crafts and industries in large numbers but also upon the surplus population of counties from all over the British Isles .

Who should social anthropologists hold that language makes so much difference ?

As capital was generated by French , Belgian , Dutch and British industrial power , so the new industrial middle classes began to demand luxury goods : the trade in furs from Poland and Russia improved massively and Manchester , which had previously exported cotton cloth and some Yorkshire manufactured woollen goods to Danzig in return for flax and hemp , now began to open up its own fur trade based on imports from the Baltic — Manchester 's Danzig Street ( which changed its name from Charter Street by residents ' petition in the mid-1860s ) commemorates the trade of this period .
