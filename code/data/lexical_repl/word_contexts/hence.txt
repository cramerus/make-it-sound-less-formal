It can , however , be claimed that though the expansion of employment in the public sector was not directly responsible for the decline in the number of people employed in the manufacturing sector because it did not use the same labour sources and because there was no labour shortage anyhow , it was , nevertheless , indirectly responsible because it led to a decline in private profit and hence to a shortage of capital for investment in the manufacturing industries .

Thus , an uncompetitive market structure may be maintained indefinitely because of barriers to entry and exit ; products are not , as in the model , homogeneous , but have differentiating characteristics which enable producers to raise prices without causing a total shift in demand to their rivals ; and finally , purchasers lack perfect information and hence may pay higher prices than they would if aware of alternative , cheaper , sources of supply .

Large-scale redundancies , particularly where the company employs a sizeable proportion of the workforce , are liable to result in a substantial reduction in local purchasing power ; this may in turn have a knock-on effect on other local businesses and on local tax revenues and hence municipally-provided services , and the ensuing high level of unemployment is likely to contribute more generally to a weakening of community relations .

In truth , the fact that a position of power might be attained as a result of ‘ private ’ contracting in itself says nothing about the legitimacy of the possession of that power , and hence even if the company could be explained in purely contractual terms this would , without more , have little impact on the question of the propriety of state intervention .

It is not clear how this issue could be resolved , other than by stipulation , and hence rather than attempt to reach a conclusion we will proceed to the more fundamental question of whether the shareholders should , in the first place , be considered to have a moral right to decide how companies should be run in virtue of their ownership of corporate property .

The law recognises that the shareholders ' interest lies ultimately in the value of their shares and not in the business as such , or at least , it recognises that it should be the shareholders who determine the outcome of a bid , and hence ( as we will see in more detail in Chapter 5 ) prohibits certain forms of defensive action on the part of the target company board which could have the effect of depriving the members of an opportunity to dispose of their investment on favourable terms .

An objective duty to balance potentially conflicting interests would present the courts with a near-impossible task and hence it is impracticable to impose one : not only would the court need to assess the likely impact on each group of a contested business policy , both in the short and long term , but also it would have to evaluate the policy in accordance with a theory which stipulated when one set of interests should prevail over the others .

If the duty is framed in subjective terms , as we have seen , the practical effect is not to impose a duty but to confer a discretion and hence a management which is not disposed to sacrifice profits ( or otherwise depart from its chosen course ) in order to advance other interests will not be compelled to alter its behaviour .

The main significance claimed for the market for corporate control as an efficiency- inducing device is not so much that companies are actually taken-over and inadequate managements displaced , though of course this does happen and is regarded as a valuable effect of the mechanism , but that incumbent managements fear take-over and hence will do all they can to make the company efficient and the share price correspondingly high .

Hume 's argument , however , does not hold water for the simple reason that it assumes that the question of the possibility of significantly ascribing identity to objects as ontological existents can and should be decided via an analysis of the conditions of their identification , whereas the simple fact is that the concept of an entity as a potential topic of discourse is analytically linked with , and hence inseparable from , that of identity .

The only possible way in which a government might try to use its ability to affect aggregate demand , in order to influence the level of aggregate output , would be to introduce random movements in its policies and hence random movements in aggregate demand which , as we have shown above , would produce deviations of aggregate output away from its natural level .

For example , if the expected price level always equals last period 's price level then , by linking the change in the money supply to last period 's price level , it will always be possible to ensure that the actual price level exceeds the expected price level and hence that output is kept above its natural level .

For example , if expected inflation rises to 5 per cent then actual inflation of 5 per cent no longer fools anyone : hence unemployment will be the same as it was when actual and expected inflation were both zero .
for example , if expected inflation rises to 5 per cent then actual inflation of 5 per cent no longer fools anyone : [so/as such] unemployment will be the same as it was when actual and expected inflation were both zero .

Similarly , just as when expectations of inflation were zero actual inflation of 5 per cent might sufficiently fool workers to generate an unemployment rate of 3 per cent , now , if expectations of inflation are 5 per cent , actual inflation would need to be 10 per cent to fool them by the same amount as before and hence generate the same unemployment rate of 3 per cent .

If supply is modelled as a function of this ‘ intertemporal ’ relative price term , one implication is that a permanent rise in the rate of growth of aggregate demand and hence in the rate of inflation may permanently reduce the quantity of output supplied , since it permanently reduces the real rate of return on holding the proceeds from sales in the form of money .

But if it is desirable to assign a property to an entity , then that will far more frequently , although not invariably , be needed precisely when the property is not an inherent quality of the entity in question ; further , this will especially be so when the property is tied to some particular event — hence the high incidence of present and past participles among postnominals .

Passive participles provide a rich vein of relevant instances ; it is a commonplace that these can be construed either as related directly to a verb , and hence in many cases referring to some assumed event , or as being adjectives expressing a state that have lost their verbal connexion .

5.5 This conclusion will actually exclude the great majority of verbs ( or , more exactly , all normal uses of the great majority of verbs ) from appearing in construction with an adverbal adjective at all , with or without the claimed nuance ; either they will be related to their object in such a way that there is simply no need to mention any particular property of the latter entity , as in ( 30 ) ; or , even if there is some property of the object specially relevant to the notion introduced in the verb , that property does not belong to the object by virtue of the relationship between the verb and the object ; for instance , even if Angela in ( 31 ) resembles her cousin in that they are both dark , her cousin does not have that property because Angela resembles her , and even if the Prince admired his Chief Justice because of his disposition to clemency it is not the the Prince 's admiration that justifies the applicability of the property merciful .

Another such verb is leave ; hence example ( 3 ) ( b ) from Chapter 4 , repeated here : ( 40 ) this process leaves the items date-stamped is in fact structurally ambiguous in three ways rather than two , since the final adjective may be a postnominal attributive , a predicate qualifier , or an adverbal ; it remains true , however , that the ambiguity is one of structure rather than a matter of elusive `` shades of lexical meaning `` .
