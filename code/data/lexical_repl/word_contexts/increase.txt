It seems likely that improvements in the health and work capacity of the elderly population over the last eighty years have more than compensated for any putative increase in the physical and mental demands of employment ; if so , rising retirement rates may reflect a decrease in the demand for the labour of elderly workers over a period in which their employment capacity has risen .

One consequence of the rise in private asset ownership among elderly people is that many of them do not suffer any drastic reduction of their ability to consume on retirement : indeed , tax changes in the 1970s that encouraged pension schemes to pay out some of their assets as a lump sum mean that many retirees experience an increase in their consumption propensity in the first few years of retirement .

What do we think about this increased reporting ? Is it good that rape is now reported , and its existence no longer denied ? Is this coming into the open of crimes against women useful in assisting reforms in this area ? Or are the stereotypes of rape portrayed by the press so narrow and unusual that they hinder the process of effective intervention by the state and others . Does the reporting raise women 's fear of crime ? In a society where many women are afraid to walk alone at night does this increase in reporting increase women 's fear still further ? Do the rape reports encourage further rapes , by providing information to potential rapists ? Does the pornographic nature of some of the reports encourage attitudes which facilitate rape ? Given that we have so little information about rape , does the increased press reporting , given its restricted nature , hinder the chance of a raped woman getting a fair ‘ trial ’ ? Are juries increasingly inhibited from convicting men who are different from this stereotype ? Does the press narrow popular conceptions of rape and make it more difficult for raped women to obtain justice ? If the reports do contribute negatively , what should be done about it ? Should they be compulsorily edited so as to be accurate and balanced , that is censored ? Or is this going too far and risks losing more , in terms of freedom of speech , than we would gain ?

For example , Hannan ( 1969 ) found that the number of young people in an area tended to increase outmigration , as the more able young left to follow the kind of careers not available in rural areas , though Grafton ( 1982 ) has argued that young people do not outmigrate from remote rural areas at a faster rate than their counterparts in less remote rural areas , and that any decline in such areas is due to lower levels of immigration , rather than higher rates of outmigration .

In summary , the detailed empirical work outlined above has enabled another general law to be formulated , the principle of circular and cumulative causation , in which the key factors are : an initial reduction in farm employment ; which is followed by a deterioration in the age structure ; which is in turn followed by a reduced rate of natural increase which then leads to a reduced population which in turn leads to reduced demands for rural services and thus a reduced demand for rural employment which then triggers another circular decline ( Hodge and Whitby , 1981 ) .

Accordingly , Drudy and Drudy ( 1979 ) have advocated the provision of professional and office jobs , and Gilg ( 1976 ) has advocated more jobs in office employment and tourism , as well as jobs in manufacturing , as an alternative to agricultural employment , so that not only the aspirations of the whole ability range of young people may be met ( Drudy , 1975 ) but also to increase the level of female activity rates found in many rural areas ( Moseley and Darby , 1978 ) .

It should be noted that although the total population over 65 is not expected to increase for the remainder of the twentieth century , this is due to a projected fall in the numbers aged 60/65–74 ( by 5 per cent between 1981 and 1991 ) combined with a rise in the numbers at older ages .

But staying with this definition for the time being , there is a general assumption in much writing in this field that although total age related dependency may not be about to rise very much , the shift to larger numbers of elderly and the fall in the numbers of the very young will increase the costs of dependency because the elderly are more costly ; they make more demands on expensive services than the young .

Although the numbers of such changes associated with moves are not large , and they can not account for more than a very small part of the differential in unemployment rates between the two groups , the sale of a large proportion of public housing to sitting tenants who are more likely to be employed than the general local authority sector population will have contributed to the increase in the unemployment rate differential referred to earlier .

The operation of the usual `` ratchet `` provisions attaching to management 's ordinary shares , whereby the percentage holding of Newco conferred by their shares , or the value of those shares , will automatically increase in accordance with profitability or performance targets of the underlying business , will not usually constitute a `` chargeable event `` for the purposes of s78 .

Accordingly , the increase in value of the shares does not derive from the removal or variation of a restriction , or the creation or variation of a right , relating to the shares , ie there is no novus actus interveniens which gives rise to the increase in value .

It is also helpful if the managers ' shares carry rights which , initially , are less beneficial than the rights attaching to the institutions ' shares but which , in accordance with pre-determined ratchet formulae in the Articles of Newco , can increase in value ( as a result of profitability targets being met ) at a rate faster than can the institutions ' shares .

This has a dual benefit in that : ( a ) the increase in value should not be caught by the unapproved share schemes legislation because it derives from entrenched rights of the ratchet variety described above ; and ( b ) it provides a justification for the managers paying less per share than the institutions at the outset , since the ratchet characteristics of the shares , and the possibility that Newco may never achieve the profitability targets , would be relevant in valuing that class of shares .

If a method can be devised of enabling employees to acquire and sell shares in an unquoted company , and benefit from the increase in value of those shares over the employee 's period of ownership , then it is perceived that employees will wish to participate in the share capital and growth of their employing company and will be motivated to work to increase the value of the business .

Newco will wish to attribute as much of the purchase price as possible to those of the assets which are likely to increase in value , but which Newco may be intending to dispose of at a later date , so as to minimise the gain arising on the disposal ( and to maximise the amount of base cost which can be indexed for capital gains tax purposes , again to reduce the ultimate gain ) .

Different classes of share will be created and issued by the company to the management and the investors in order : ( a ) to allow a large share capital to be created without unduly diluting the management 's interest ; ( b ) to reduce the investors ' risk by providing a part of the share capital to be in the form of preference shares , which will enable the company to redeem as quickly as the cash flow and profits allow ; ( c ) to set up a " ratchet " mechanism which will allow for the management shareholding to increase with the success of the company . The following are the types of share that will ordinarily be seen in a management buy-out :

These shares are held by the investors , and on the triggering of the ratchet — the achievement of certain projections or market capitalisation on a flotation , for example — all or some of the convertible redeemable preference shares will be redeemed ; but if the results fall short of what is expected then they will be converted into ordinary shares and as a result increase the investor 's share of the equity at the expense of the proportion held by management .

This is less important than in a share sale where the difficulty of the purchaser , without an express damage statement , is to show that the shares are worth less than the purchaser paid for them , as a reduction in the assets or increase in the liabilities does not necessarily reduce the price of the shares .

The Keynesian concludes , therefore , that an increase in the money supply would not have a marked effect on economic activity since : ( a ) the money supply only influences economic activity indirectly via interest rates , and the latter may not be significantly affected anyway because all parts of the financial market bear the burden of adjustment ; and ( b ) investment expenditures may not be very sensitive to changes in interest rates .

Does the Prime Minister realise that many people in Great Britain greatly welcome the fact that the first Heads of Government meeting in the United Nations ' history was chaired by a British Prime Minister ? Does he further realise that what will also have been welcomed and noted is the difference in attitude between the Prime Minister and that of his predecessor towards the United Nations ?

Before we go on to consider these studies of local politics , think about other major economic and social changes that have taken place within Britain since the mid-1970s — such as deindustrialization , or the large increase in home ownership . Would you expect these to be accompanied by an increasing diversity of local political activity ? If so , why should this be the case ? What form would you expect such local politics to take ? Should they necessarily be restricted to electoral variations , or even to activity around state institutions such as local government ?

Some portion of the change in the market value of existing assets may reflect increased productive capacity and thus could represent income and saving , but it is difficult to isolate that portion.16 Most gains and losses from transferring assets within and between sectors `` wash out '' at the national level and may not represent newly available resources for the economy as a whole.17 For example , when one household sells an appreciated asset to another household , any gain realized may be used to finance the seller 's consumption , but the transaction does not increase the nation 's income or output .

If the prices of all basic mail were increased , say , 20 % , the 33.6¢ , the 45.0¢ , and the 39.2¢ average would all increase by 20 % .
if the prices of all basic mail were increased , say , 20 % , the 33.6¢ , the 45.0¢ , and the 39.2¢ average would all [raise] by 20 % .

If the price of basic mail is incresed and the price of workshared mail is held constant , the discount will increase automatically and volume will decline for two reasons : ( 1 ) because the price is higher , some customers will reduce usage and ( 2 ) because the discount is higher , some customers will decide to workshare and will leave basic .

In Equation ( 15 ) , an increase in Pws amounts to a decrease in the discount , causing workshared mail to stop worksharing and shift to Vb .
in equation ( 15 ) , an [raise] in pws amounts to a decrease in the discount , causing workshared mail to stop worksharing and shift to vb .

Thus , a 1-cent increase in the discount causes about 2.5 % of the basic volume to shift to presort .
thus , a 1-cent [raise] in the discount causes about 2.5 % of the basic volume to shift to presort .

Since the models being used here are characterized by strong cross elasticities , it was necessary to develop a method of dealing with the shifting curves and with mailers that shift toward worksharing when the discounts increase .
