Is the Prime Minister aware , first , that people will want to study in detail what he has brought back and will need far more time to do that , and , secondly , that a treaty committing us to a European union probably represents an even bigger change than our entry into the Community in 1975 , the long-term effect of which over many Parliaments will be great ? In those circumstances , does he really think that a dying Parliament , a week after the Maastricht summit , should empower a lame-duck Prime Minister to use the royal prerogative to sign that treaty without any consultation with the British people whose rights will be affected far more than this Parliament ? Does he not think that , with a general election coming , if he is confident in his position , the least that he could do would be to put that forward in a general election so that at least people will have an opportunity to give a view before they are committed by the right hon. Gentleman 's signature of a treaty of this magnitude ?

They recommended that molecular prognostic studies be classified as phase 1 ( early exploratory probing associations ) , phase 2 ( exploratory with extensive analyses ) , or phase 3 ( large confirmatory studies with pre-stated hypotheses and precise quantification of the magnitude of the effect ) , and that only studies that had undergone phase 3 testing should be considered robust enough for use in clinical practice .

For example , 1 ) in Type 1 diabetes mellitus , the bulk of both the linkage and association data implicate the HLA region and INS [ 22 ] ; 2 ) for Type 2 diabetes mellitus , there are a number of findings in the literature where the association evidence appears to be consistent and compelling ( CAPN10 , KCNJ11 , and PPARG ) —the data indicate that the same marker allele is significantly associated and has an effect size of similar direction and magnitude [ 22 ] ( the linkage data are less congruent , probably due to power considerations ) ; and 3 ) for age-related macular degeneration , at least five studies show highly significant association with the same CFH Y402H polymorphism [ 23–27 ] in a region strongly implicated by multiple linkage studies .
