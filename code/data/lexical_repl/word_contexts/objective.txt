Before considering how ( and how far ) these three features are actually manifested in the different positivist theories , there are two other contingent and interdependent features that Jeffery ( and Matza following him ) pick on as of central significance to the positivist programme : the shift of focus from crime to the criminal , and the quest for a universal , objective category of ‘ criminal ’ behaviour .

But , as in other areas of enforcement activity , the quantitative measures available in pollution control have only limited utility since , like crime rates , statistics of ‘ pollution ’ and ‘ compliance ’ reflect the behaviour of enforcement agents rather than some ‘ objective ’ measurement of the phenomena themselves ( Cicourel , 1968 ) .

Now it might be argued as was done by Kant , for example — that the idea of a non-arbitrary , objective , order is built into the very concept of an external object ; that one can not significantly refer to external objects qua external without acknowledging by implication the existence of such an order ; and in a sense this is of course true .

Reverting now to spatio-temporal relations , the assumption of their irreducibility to monadic predicates is linked with the assumption that they depict an objective order , and if such relations are taken to depict an objective order , then it is clear that we shall have to assume the possibility of a plurality of biographically distinct points of view , occupied by different percipients , before we can make any significant inferences about the ontological distinguishability of their terms .

To put it differently , if spatiotemporal relations are to be appealed to in support of the thesis that there can be numerically , not just qualitatively , distinguishable ontological existents , it is necessary , in the first place , to clarify the conditions under which such relations can be significantly claimed to reflect the structure of an objective world , and in trying to do so we are likely to find that in some form or other we need to assume what such relations are supposed to explain .

But this merely confirms yet again that the idea of numerical diversity of ontological existents is inseparable from the idea of an objective order , and consequently that a clarification of the former idea depends upon a clarification of the sources and the conditions of intelligibility of such an order .

Here , it is enough to note that the adoption , largely at Owen 's prompting , by the trade union movement of the strategic objective of organising manufacturing industry in industrial co-operatives , of adopting Co-operation for its own sake so as to make a revolutionary change in the constitutional structure of society , ended almost as soon as it had begun .

The Watts and Quimby study also demonstrated a relationship between subjective and objective risk , there was a correlation of 0.37 between subjective ratings of the chance of being involved in a near miss and objective risk , measured as accidents divided by mean traffic flow at a site .

It is interesting to note that the correlation between objective and subjective risk measured by Watts & Quimby ( 1980 ) is of a similar magnitude to the correlation between estimated risk and objective risk reported by Brehmer ( 1987 ) — Brehmer in fact uses the term subjective risk , however , in this study subjects were not actually driving or even simulating it , thus it seems more appropriate to regard this as estimated risk .

An additional measure of objective risk which is similar to the one used in the Watts and Quimby ( 1980 ) study was obtained by simply dividing the number of accidents by the traffic flow ( note that the units of this measure are essentially arbitrary ) .

Subjective risk ratings , surprisingly , were only very weakly related to the objective risk of accident as assessed by the actual number of accidents divided by the average traffic flow .

The reason for this may largely be the types of road used in the two studies , the roads in the Watts and Quimby study were divided approximately equally between rural and suburban areas and thus provides much greater variations in traffic flow , and hence objective risk , than those used in this study .

Watts and Quimby also used many sites which were not at junctions , sites which generally ranked extremely low on both subjective and objective risk .

It is thus not clear that these accident estimates are particularly stable assessments of the objective danger at the junction ; they are likely to be strongly determined by risk ratings .

The high correlation between accident estimate and risk rating observed , r ( 46 ) =0.75 , p < 0.01 , may reflect the objective correlation that should exist between these measures or it may simply be that subjects were not completely successful in dissociating the two scales .
