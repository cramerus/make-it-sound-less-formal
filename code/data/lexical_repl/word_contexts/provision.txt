But as the reader will be aware , during the past decade or so , the courts , building on a series of decisions which quite properly and logically held ineffective a number of ingenious and entirely artificial schemes devised for the manufacture and allowance of losses or expenses which were never in fact incurred , have sought to create and apply to transactions conferring tax advantages for which the legislature has made provision a doctrine of ‘ legitimate business purpose ’ , the general effect of which is that even though the citizen follows to the letter that which Parliament has told him that he can do in order to attract the fiscal consequences which Parliament has statutorily decreed will follow if he does it , nevertheless , whatever Parliament may have said shall be the consequences , the courts will and must decline to give effect , not to what he has done , but to the fiscal consequences which Parliament has provided , unless he demonstrates that there was a ‘ legitimate business purpose ’ for his action .

It is by now quite well known ( certainly it will have come to the attention of those who attended the Statute Law Society 's Annual Conference at Cambridge in 1988 ) that the European Court 's method of interpreting Community legal texts is primarily teleological , that is to say the interpretation of a provision on the basis of its object and purpose .

Hence , the usual practice of the European Court is to interpret the text in question in the light of its spirit , general scheme , and wording as well as the overall legal context , in particular the system and objectives of the founding treaties and the instrument containing the provision .

In the instant case the words of section 6 ( 4 ) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 that fall to be construed , ‘ provision in relation to … retirement ’ , without any undue straining of the ordinary meaning of the language used , are capable of bearing either the narrow meaning accepted by the Employment Appeal Tribunal or the wider meaning preferred by the Court of Appeal but acknowledged by that court to be largely a matter of first impression .

This is that , where there is judicial uncertainty over the meaning of a legislative text , in the absence of any consequent overt expression of a contrary parliamentary view , certain categories of statement on the effect of the provision of a Bill by one of a narrowly defined group of parliamentarians , if not later withdrawn or varied , can be assumed to be an expression of parliamentary intention .

Assuming admissible statements to establish parliamentary intention are limited , as would appear presently to be the case , to parliamentary statements , there remain grey areas in the application of the rule . for instance , are the parliamentary statements limited to those made during consideration of the Bill ? Could a relevant statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget Speech be admissible for establishing parliamentary intention in the construction of a provision of a finance Act in the absence of a clear ministerial statement during the passage of the Bill ?

In seeking to contribute to this research agenda we need to address a number of issues which emerge both from this earlier literature and from some initial observation in a number of social work teams organized in differing ways . How , for example , is an organizational type to be defined and how many are to be selected ? Is the area team to be the focus or is organization at secondary level to be addressed ? Are we to concur with Stevenson 's conclusion ( 1981 ) that ‘ it is hard to see how we can escape in general in organization of service from the broad client groupings , now so deeply entrenched in social service provision and in the linkages which are required with other professions ’ ( p. 100 ) , and if so how are we to select client group(s) ? From whose perspective are we interested in the problem ? Our primary concern above dictates the inclusion of certain client outcome measures across the organizational types , but are we interested also in outcomes as perceived by the client , the worker , by management or by other agencies ? More specifically , what should be the specific outcome measures that are selected and to what extent should they represent ‘ final ’ outcomes or more intermediate measures that may signify process ?

In this paper , we focus on those results of our research that ( 1 ) suggest that profession-centred approaches to social service provision should be modified ; ( 2 ) team models of practice need to be more widely adopted ; ( 3 ) both professionals and paraprofessionals need specific training for effective team functioning ; ( 4 ) paraprofessional training must affirm and build upon indigenous characteristics and skills ; and ( 5 ) more attention needs to be devoted to career advancement opportunities for paraprofessional personnel .

The Barclay Report ( 1982 ) on the role and tasks of social workers recognized the limitations of the prevailing ‘ one case/one worker ’ approach to social service provision and felt there was some merit in the neighbourhood- or community-based model of practice , using teams of diverse personnel , led by a professionally-trained worker .
