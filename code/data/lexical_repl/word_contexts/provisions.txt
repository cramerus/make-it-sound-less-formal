By refusing to agree to the social chapter , is not he wanting to exclude British people from the provisions for equal status for 6 million part-time employees , many of whom are women ; for fair and equal treatment for women at work ; for proper protection for young people at work ; for rights to minimum holiday leave ; and for better information for employees ? He claims that those decent basic provisions for individual employees , whether they are in or out of trade unions , would inhibit competitiveness . But how does he answer his fellow Conservatives like Herr Kohl , or Mr. Eyskens , of Belgium , who says : ’ It is a fact that the most competitive countries in Europe are also the ones with the best social and employment provision ’ ?

Did the Prime Minister feel no sense of humiliation at having to meet the other 11 Heads of Government and having to explain to them in the most public way why the British economy was so uniquely vulnerable and fragile that we alone were unable to provide the basic minimum provisions of the social charter ? If he thinks that he can come back to the House , whatever the supine press may say , and present it as a triumph for Britain that he has managed to prevent those provisions from being applied in this country , although they are being applied everywhere else , he shows that the Government are not only economically bankrupt but bankrupt of values .
