The central paradox of this kind of ‘ trading places ’ is that through the very symmetry of its inversions it postulates imaginary correspondences between black and white positions even as it seeks to naturalize difference and domination .

Are racial double standards ( viz. , good/bad natives ) and double binds ( damned if you are different and damned if you are like the master race ) a function of this contradictory or dual relation to the Other ? Or do we have to look to more concrete and historically specific forms of mediation to explain the racialization of envy and desire ?

Where does this leave us today ? Despite the recent re-issue of Rewald 's classic monograph , we still lack a true catalogue raisonné , bringing together all the visual and documentary material and engaging with the fundamental issues ; for example , after the sensational exhibition of the Mellon waxes at the National Gallery in Washington in 1991 , there is an even greater need for a study of the relationship of the waxes to the 1,500 or so bronze casts scattered throughout the world ; more understanding of Degas ' techniques and the reproductive processes used by his founder is urgently required ; a consideration of the images themselves , and their place in contemporary sculpture , is conspicuous by its absence ; and , the biggest question of all , the role of these wax figures in the wider oeuvre cries out to be examined .

The Court of Appeal held that because the principle of effective protection only required that national courts should provide remedies for the protection of European rights which were as effective as the remedies available for the protection of similar rights in English law ; and since a plaintiff can recover damages against governmental bodies in English law only if a breach of private law can be shown ; and since the challenged action would not be actionable in tort in English law ; it followed that the principle of effective protection did not require that damages be available to the plaintiff as a remedy .

The reason for this in turn is quite straightforward : in any language which makes a distinction between nouns and adjectives , it will be natural to use an adjective when assignment of a property is required ; it may sometimes be quite easy to find an adjective and a noun which express near enough — or even exactly — the same properties , and differ only in that one is an adjective and the other is a noun , but to use the latter for assignment is to risk conveying the unwanted imputation of `` entity-hood `` on top of the semantic value required ( see Section 1.10 ) ; therefore when a noun or noun phrase is chosen it will normally presuppose that the construction is not that of assignment of a property but instead one of equation .

In seeking to contribute to this research agenda we need to address a number of issues which emerge both from this earlier literature and from some initial observation in a number of social work teams organized in differing ways . How , for example , is an organizational type to be defined and how many are to be selected ? Is the area team to be the focus or is organization at secondary level to be addressed ? Are we to concur with Stevenson 's conclusion ( 1981 ) that ‘ it is hard to see how we can escape in general in organization of service from the broad client groupings , now so deeply entrenched in social service provision and in the linkages which are required with other professions ’ ( p. 100 ) , and if so how are we to select client group(s) ? From whose perspective are we interested in the problem ? Our primary concern above dictates the inclusion of certain client outcome measures across the organizational types , but are we interested also in outcomes as perceived by the client , the worker , by management or by other agencies ? More specifically , what should be the specific outcome measures that are selected and to what extent should they represent ‘ final ’ outcomes or more intermediate measures that may signify process ?

We can just as readily conclude that there is just one type of latent inhibition ; that the change induced by exposure to the stimulus always tends to dissipate during the exposure — test interval ; and that the size of the interval required for such a loss of latent inhibition to become apparent grows longer as the strength of the effect induced by the initial exposure phase is increased .

It also focussed attention at each level on the measures of performance required for effective monitoring and control , and the information dependencies of all subsystems .

This further expansion gave greater insight into the information requirements of the system ( eg for the activity Tender for services , information about tender procedures , potential contractors , standards required , etc could be relevant ) , and could be checked against the information actually available in practice , an approach that is examined further in Chapter 11 .
