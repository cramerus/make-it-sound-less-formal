However , as Lennie ( 1980 ) points out , that does not mean that these cells respond more rapidly to visual stimuli than the other classes , since the latency of response to visual input is determined largely by events in the retina At low spatial frequencies they are linear but as the spatial frequency is increased non-linear properties emerge .

Recent studies of language acquisition reveal that children are very attentive , and actively process evidence in ways perhaps not fully appreciated at the time when Chomsky was championing a theory of innate linguistic universals that depended heavily on an alleged gap between the scanty data available to the child and the rich system that he eventually masters in response thereto .

First , he argued that it is highly artificial to construe all consumption as a response to needs ; while this approach may seem illuminating when it is applied to the consumption of individuals , it can not plausibly be extended to productive consumption , which has to be treated as ‘ the consumption which satisfies the needs of production ’ , if the theory is to be sustained .

The recognition that we can not give complete holist explanations of social phenomena does not undermine the centrality of the intuition to which the doctrine , in its various forms , is a response : the sense that many properties of individuals , whether tastes , aspirations , beliefs , expectations or habits , are to an over-whelming extent formed by society .

The expressive scale begins with an examination of the child 's use of words to express emotional states and in response to specific situations — for example , ‘ ta ’ on taking something — and proceeds to explore the child 's command of simple vocabulary items through picture naming and in response to requests for definitions — for example , ‘ What is a shop ? ’ The final part of the language expression scale calls upon the child to describe pictures where scoring is determined by the number of ideas expressed .

There seems no a priori reason why the intellectual collapse of the radical bourgeoisie in the early nineteenth century should necessitate a single line of avant-garde response — rather than a multiplicity of struggles , which , instead of leading irrevocably to extreme Schoenbergian individualism , might , for example , ‘ preserve ’ ( that is reuse ) older elements , to be rearticulated to the interests of new group subjects if and when they emerged .

There is , however , a lot to be gained from a consideration of Canova 's response to the human figure both as a starting point for the investigation of sculpture where ‘ dream , myth and reverie ’ are cited as key notes of interpretation , and an investigation of nuances of meaning which the application of the words ‘ sensual ’ or ‘ sensuous ’ may have when applied to sculpture , an art form which after all is made and largely understood through touch .

It seems that in the case of the higher primates the diffusion and decay of specific instinctual behaviours has facilitated — perhaps even necessitated — the evolution of a primitive and elementary ego-organization , that is , one in which unfocused instinctual drives are increasingly brought under the control of the higher cortical centres which facilitate drive-management and decision-making on the basis of great adaptive flexibility of response .

Thus when the chimpanzee , supplied in the laboratory with two boxes and a stick to reach a suspended bunch of bananas , stops leaping up and trying the reach them with its hands and instead puts one box on top of the other , climbs up and dislodges the bananas with the stick , it is using to the full its basic ability to suppress the automatic response — leaping up — in favour of the intelligent one — climbing up and reaching with the stick .

The interpretation put forward here is not fundamentally different from that offered by Jaynes when he suggested that a tendency to emit ( a fractional version of ) the response acquired in the first stage would serve as a mediating process in the second , and that the salience of the mediator would depend on the magnitude of the initial response of which it was a fraction .

Indeed the changes wrought by the Prussians were to have enormous consequences for the formation of nationalist opinion in the city after the First World War , and it is important to see the extent to which these policies provided the basis of German identity and political purpose in the east , and provoked the very Polish nationalist response they supposedly sought to suppress or prevent .

It considers the way in which we might make a reality of the observation ( by Keith Joseph ) that ‘ the curriculum should be relevant to the real world and pupils ’ experience of it ' by considering the range of challenges and opportunities which people face in , say , the domestic environment , often regarded as too trivial for ‘ academic ’ education , but where arguably most important economic , technical and social decisions are made and acted upon : in the community where a host of issues require an informed public to exercise judgment and active commitment to ensure that the quality of the social and physical environment is constantly improved , and so on in other contexts which will require people to make an active and hopefully informed response , underlain by conceptual understanding of general issues to which , if taught effectively , geography , history , physical sciences and design , indeed all academic disciplines , can make a powerful contribution .

Second , although there is no reason to expect any model to be other than linear and additive , there is an argument , presented by Flowerdew ( 1988 ) , which says that since the response variable compromises count data , the appropriate regression model should combine a Poisson error distribution with an identity link function ( see Aitkin et al .
