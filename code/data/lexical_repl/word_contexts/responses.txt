Two- and three-year-olds , who did not yet know less , were not as consistent , and their responses to less and tiv — and possibly to more as well — suggested that , in the absence of lexical knowledge , they were probably relying on a non-linguistic strategy of choosing the greater amount ( Trehub and Abramovitch , 1978 ) .
