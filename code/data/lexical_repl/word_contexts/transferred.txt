I doubt that it is accurate to define gunsel as a ` callow youth , ' a sense that probably rubbed off from the character played by Elisha Cook , Jr. in The Maltese Falcon : though he was referred to ( by Bogart , as I recall ) as a ` punk ' and ` gunsel ' and was portrayed as ineffectual , that does not justify a transferred definition : gunsel , probably from Yiddish , is a less common , old-fashioned term for ` gunman , body guard , torpedo , hit man , ' and the like , simply a ` criminal who carries a gun , ' and needs no ( additional ) pejorative treatment .
