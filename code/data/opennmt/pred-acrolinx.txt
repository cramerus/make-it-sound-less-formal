Imagine you have just written what you believe is a great piece of content .
You are ready to get it off your plate and send it to the world .
But , wait , a second !
Before you hit the publish button , are you positive that you have done everything you can ensure to ensure your content is success ?
After all , you have probably worked hard to create that piece of content , so do n't you want to be sure that it will work just as hard for you ?
In my opinion , we think content marketers should always ask themselves before they publish their content .
Maybe you are already asking yourself some of them , which is a good start .
However , unless you can answer yes to all of them for every piece of content you create , you are doing your content .
If you do not want to miss out on an opportunity to make your content great , is it really readable ?
It is easy to bog down in ways that make it hard for readers to understand .
Using long sentences , a lot of acronyms , or industry sentences , or industry jargon for example , not only for example .
Do your readers a favor and you are writing .
They will appreciate it .
Do you think it was too easy ?
Even though we want people to read our content , the reality is that people are short on time and often skim .
That is why you should always ensure that your content is laid out to communicate every word .
I can often sub-heads Breaking up long , easier-to-consume and Putting .
Long documents often benefit from an issue or callouts .
Was it written with a specific audience ?
As writers , we always want our content to resonate with our audiences .
Unless we have a good understanding of who our audience is , and care about what they need and care about .
If you write your next piece of content , what pain points do you have ?
What types of content do they prefer to consume ?
What style is going to be most effective with them ?
The more you consider your audience , the better the content you create is going to be .
Can you have the appropriate tone of voice ?
While you are thinking about your audience , think about what kind of voice is most likely to resonate with them .
Is it acceptable to adopt a casual tone or is something more formal ?
Are you writing for a general audience or for a while of knowledge and improve ?
It is okay to introduce a little humor into your writing or does it have to be strictly professional .
I am getting the tone of voice , but it is just to creating a piece of content that works for your audience .
Does it provide value to the reader ?
This is one of the main issues in the world .
You will have to give your audience information that they need or want .
It is not longer enough to simply simply tout to simply tout of your business , and your services .
Instead , you 've got to use your content as a way of conveying to your audience , how they may be facing whatever problems they may be .
If you do not , then you will be wasting their time .
I think it is for search .
You need to make your content attractive to search engines .
This would mean adding keywords in the right places of the right places to name your content including the first sentence and to name a few .
Adding links to other pages is not able to help .
Is it possible to call to action ?
The whole point of creating content is to get your audience to do something as a result .
It could be something as simple as consuming . Even more content , it could be getting them to make a purchase .
No matter what the case may be , your audience will not do anything unless you direct them to action .
Do not dilute your message with too many calls to action .
One or at most two is all you should include .
Does it have a lot of effort and image ?
With so much content competing for people 's attention , you have to work hard at attracting people to yours .
Basically , the only bait we have received are the headlines and images that people see before clicking on a particular piece of content .
While some of your headlines are headlines , they are engaging in the activity when the click through the click .
You should be high quality , visually engaging in generic positions .
Does it give credit where credit is due ?
There are many great ideas out there , and not all of them are going to be yours .
It is fine to share other people 's ideas , but when you do , make sure you give them credit for it .
Take care to cite your sources .
It will make you look more credible and trustworthy , it will keep you out of trouble over the long term .
Do you have a strategy for the right people to the right people ?
Just the content is the first step in content marketing .
What are you going to do after you publish it to front of the right people ?
Find out the content to your website . You need to consider how you can promote it through social media , influencer .
This is an important piece of puzzle , and if you are not giving it the attention , you should be disappointed .
Can you answer yes to all ten questions ?
Are there any other questions that you like to ask yourself before you publish your content ?
We recently shared a post containing a list of the problem that writers that writers that writers that writers wrong .
This week we are at it again with the second half of the list .
The words are easy to take for granted , but some of them are easy to think .
Even if you are confident that you are using them all correctly , you might just learn a thing or two by taking a quick read and examples we 've provided .
I adjectives and Alternative These words .
I believe it means every other in a series .
Alternative one of two or more possibilities .
The other one of a series of two , an alternate of two , an alternate may stand for a `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` For a Blue '' sense .
For instance , as the flooded left them , no alternative , they took an alternate route .
I Amount and Number Amount to things in bulk to individual items .
I can do it to asserts to asserts to asserts to indexes .
Why do similarities with analyzes and differences ?
Different people from the used is used when a comparison is drawn directly in goals .
It is different when the object of comparison is different than it used to be .
Because of , and it is On Account to modifies a noun , because her success is due to her hard work .
From and on account of modify , Prices because of increased demand .
I believe and sixteen can be counted for things that can be counted .
For example , few people are four people who are four people who are not counted .
For example : The Office will be close if it is a holiday .
A specific option would not say if the customer has been approved .
Believe it , and Infer means : A falling stock implies to trouble in the economy .
Do Infer to assume that we can infer from the falling stock that the economy is weak ?
I believe it means innumerable .
For example , it can also function as a noun .
For example , a choices of choices Percent and Percent ; Percent is a percentage of the total of the total people and Quotation .
I am not sure about her speech .
It does n't matter in the third quarter , but it 's Irrespective of Regardless of can fluctuate .
Note : It is not a word and should not be used in place of regardless of regardless .
Now you have seen all of the problem that we have collected .
What are we missing ?
Are there other examples that you can think of , either trip up you or other writers you know ?
Please let us know in the comments section .
Even the best writers can get tripped up sometimes by the nuances writers .
That is particularly true when it comes to using certain words and phrases .
You know the ones we are talking about , do you pay someone a compliment or something ?
When do you use raise versus rise ?
There is a difference between farther and further , but what is it ?
At Acrolinx we thought we could help by sharing a list that we 've been compiling of how people often get wrong .
This list is far from complete collection . This is a bigger collection of problem that we will publish over time to time .
The include : Affect . It is Affect and Effect is a verb meaning to have an influence on the dollar .
I used as a result means a result , but i.e. on buying power is substantial power .
Note : in some instances , effect can be used as a verb meaning to bring about or something .
The following between discussing both cats and dogs .
The bands : The donation was used when discussing three or more objects .
Believe it , Ensure , and can not put the confidence .
For example , let me assure you that we have a good solution to your problem .
I believe it means to make certain .
For example , what can you do to ensure that we arrive on time ?
I believe to protect against loss of loss .
For our house , our house is for up to one million dollars .
It is possible to do something and compliment Complement means her expertise .
A nice means to flatter her on a job , and it is nice to flatter her .
It can be hard to consist of whether or not to include the parts .
Please note that it is considered considered incorrect .
I 'm not sure to make the parts of the parts .
The whole composed of the parts is composed of the parts , `` The company can units three business , units . ''
The three business units is compose the company .
I believe the company is composed of three business , however .
Each and Each other refers to two people or the two people .
One another refers to more than two : For : : The four competitors respected respected .
I am not sure and is similar to nothing more than in a greater degree .
I am uncertain .
Please use a comma before and after i.e .

A force that brings about a change of the influence of the influence , or as in nature , as in nature , or behavior : Marilyn .
Excuse me , means to impinge or strike forcefully .
It can mean to produce a material effect upon it .
The action of a stimulus is a response .
For example , our ability can affect our ability to think straight .
It will last last after the last meeting , the last meeting of the year will be held in December .
It means most of the recent report on November .
Over and even to denote Over only to denote Over your opponent 's head .
The house is from the age of 60 years old .
More than is used to mean : The company has more than $ 2.00 in assets .
Note : Over may be used in place of more than to avoid awkward , repetition .
For example , there were over 200 delegates from more than 11 countries present at the conference .
It can happen soon , in a short time .
For example , he will be going .
Currently means now .
For example , we are currently in Colorado .
Principal and also Principle , or Principal .
As an adjective , it means primary , as a noun , it means the head of money or money borrowed or invested money .
I believe the languages of languages are C++ and Java .
The school principal sent me for me .
My investment is that I wo n't lose my principal .
It means a fundamental or premise .
For example : The nation was founded on the principle of equality before the law .
Do you know the principal of the school Raise and Rise Raise is a transitive ?
Rise is an idea verb and connotes connotes self-action .
Then and Than Than in comparison , normally introducing a clause .
As time as example : Wilmer : Besides , then and now Toward , These words are preferred , but in American writing it is preferred .
We will continue to build out our list of problem soon and publish another post soon .
In the meantime , what are some of the problem that either you or others you know struggle with ?
In my opinion , a good content marketer is being resourceful and knowing what tools are available or more .
We could all do our jobs better if we had already budgets .
However , the reality is that we do not need to find creative ways to get things done .
With that in mind , it is below we 're sharing six of our favorite online tools that are partially partially partially partially partially partially or not .

This is the third post in a series about the future of technical communication .
Click the previous post .
If you are a technical , it is time for you to get out more .
That is a lot more .
I believe techcomm has led a existence , seldom straying from the technology side of product .
I given the evolving role of technical content noted in the previous post .
On the online world of the content era , play a key role in building their company 's customer relationships .
It means that you and your colleagues are certain .
That fact will make all of your strong choices for your company 's marketing team , or even joining it .
The truth is that it is often starved for content while technical , communicators is producing volumes of it .
That fact alone is the possibility of the possibility of a good marriage .
For example , a leading can Citrix , a leading innovator in mobile workspaces .
For a great marriage , one where you truly reposition yourself , however , you will have to shift not how you work about your company .
You need to begin thinking outside of the silo .
To do so , consider these questions : What does alignment marketing and your team really mean for both of you ?
What can you each deliver that information to the customer experience ?
What do those thoughts have in common ?
How do you each matter success ?
How can you define success together ?
Because marketing materials and gadgets should align in terms of language and messaging , what messages do you share ?
Think about these questions can prepare you for the conversations of your company .
To get their attention , you will need to speak about what happened with them .
For example , you should learn about the company 's key , initiatives and talk to your executives about how you can advance those .
Focus on what matters most in building customer — and allow your executives .
When speaking with your company 's executives , you can often assume that they have no idea what your impact is .
To hold their attention , you will need to connect with them .
That will depend on what you care about in the first table .
That is the point .
You need to look at the big picture and show your executives where and how you fit into it .
For example , if one of your company 's growth , it is improving with survey how techcomm shows how techcomm shows how techcomm shows how techcomm shows customer can be found .
Did you take my advice in an earlier post to set up your understand ?
You can not care about content content itself , but when you speak with the customer voice they will hear you .
Even though you understand what matters to your company , I believe goals can be new and style correct to reduce the correct terminology , but I believe you can understand what specifically you are doing .
The link is too link to link your offer to concrete examples .
You can see , this table is the reverse of the one above , but you are starting with what your senior care about .
As an example , you can support it geographical by providing content content , accuracy editing and translation .
You can improve the customer experience by offering more touch .
It seems as though you can offer a better customer points to the results of your results in the results of your results translation , but I believe you can translation the results of the results in the results of your results in a conflict , and choosing between us and placing a Lower .
In fact , it is generally a good idea to ask managers and colleagues around the things that makes them so .
Things about your understand will fall on deaf ears .
Instead , frame your data data in synch with company goals .
How many pages we write , How many pages we write , How much more work can we serve ?
Your company 's goals are always yours and you will have excellent skills to support those goals .
This is the second post in a series about future communication .
To read the first post , click here .
Afterall , take note . Thank you to the evolving role of technical content . The days of being viewed .
It educating in until recently , the conventional thinking was that technical role in their organizations , played in their organizations or call the desk .
Today 's content is the key to building relationships , however , where content is coming to appreciate techcomm .
In fact , these days a significant amount of can go through almost the entire buying process before talking to a salesperson , but relying is on their decision .
In my Sharon Burton 's 2012 . It can not occur for Feelings . For example , Feelings of Consumer , for example , 32 % of consumers look at product instructions .
The figure is likely higher for riskier or more complex products .
It is the results of a recent occurrence .
It 's worth noting for a product of technical content on their perception of technical perception on their perception of a product of technical perception .
You can set up the same issue today , and should do so today .
The impact of technical content goes even further .
Depending on their research , their results are every kind of information .
Every page represents the company and it 's brand , regardless of where it can happen .
*This content has the power to speak on behalf of your company .
Possibly loud .
For the power of technical content , technical content is greater than marketing content .
This is even more the case when technical writers engage in product in online tech with customers , either as social or through forums .
It is difficult to get heard and have the opportunity to develop connections with the ‘ .
You can use the technical content of your company 's technical content depends on more than presenting information .
It 's also expect it to be consistent in quality quality , style , and tone of voice with the other content your company .
I wonder if notice it .
For example , I know an insurance company who bragged that how easy it was to do to scramble , jargon-filled .
It can even be confusing to reverse their purchase for confusing technical content .
I can study study reports that , of nearly study that , of nearly $ 14 in consumer , and repairs in consumer in the US found in 2007 .
It 's recommendations to have a customer experience for Stronger post-sales for Stronger post-sales for Stronger post-sales .
I believe that customer conversations on social media offer technical issues into social issues .
They can also use it to make it work .
At Symantec , for example , which one of the world is largest largest largest largest largest calls calls articles that they optimized for findability .
About 4 . Who want to be seen as relevant in this new content era ? Need to understand that the content they are creating to sell their company 's product or service .
While your company can not no longer afford to undervalue and can marginalize from the organization .
Rather than simply , they should circulate , ask throughout the company of the company and offer their own ideas .
In my next post , I will talk about how sports can shape the conversations with their manager for the future .
I believe their role of techcomm in their mind .
That is because frequently frequently can not be used to cost a positive impact on customer relationships .
It is often possible to buy into this perception by seeing their value by seeing their value and troubleshooting .
However , the fact that these perceptions despite the fact that these have been slow to change , the role of technical , is for technical communication .
As the content era , it is driving six important changes , it 's driving six important changes , divided of the role in redefining , and the help desk is moving .
The separation of technical content creation makes it difficult to ensure it makes it difficult to ensure it is both technical content and compared to a company of other branded .
Generally , it also impedes quality control in other ways , by opening the door to incomplete the way .
It can be hard to explain why customer may explain why customer support are often high while satisfaction .
Getting squeezed content creation often gets it or outsourced .
A lack of respect for and understanding of can make it a target for budget cuts .
This in turn to lead to offshoring and outsourcing .
I believe it is outsourced in the hands of non-native , particularly when it is outsourced .
It can happen the problem of error-prone and inconsistent .
The absence of effective quality means that it is hard to fix errors when they occur .
In fact , it is possible that no one can relate to them .
Even speakers are also also increasingly content .
About a globally , dispersed and diverse information needs to be easy to understand and reflect local needs .
Although translation can be effective for localizing for localizing that is own challenges .
Even though it is tighter , you can requiring it to yourself .
This is due to the adoption of lean/agile .
Are the good results in yield results when properly properly implemented an technical results of frequently , well-integrated .
I can documentation on cost and speed to customer content .
It makes it difficult for technical content to stay ahead .
*This is already their product expertise in social media .
If a product can be a king or a substitute for a product , it can be a king or a substitute for customers .
Basically social media can be offers as a potentially valuable valuable for technical communicators .
If you are a technical nature , these trends much more than a changing world .
I believe that they should be a call to reposition and the content you create .
Do your company and not only do you stand to win .
How do you do that ?
To begin thinking , you need to begin thinking about your role .
For example , it is time to challenge the perception that technical communication represents a cost center .
This attitude only seems to think about how to improve the problem , further , marginalizing .
Instead , the reality is that techcomm has the potential to help drive .
However , as technical communicators , you must recognize how you can support your company 's priorities and then demonstrate your ability to do so .
To make the case that there is actually a growing demand for your content , you need to ask questions that connect with your companies .
I believe like IBM and Microsoft are already the trail .
It is quite important to have an important role to play in their companies .
It is to play that role but , however , they must persuasively exactly what their value is .
This post is the first in the series that looks at how the role of technical is shifting .
I will focus on the real value of appreciating their next blog post .
By now , you may have come across Weird Al Yankovic 's Yankovic 's . It 's a music video hit song .
The video takes a humorous approach to pointing out some of the most common language mistakes that people make .
To honor Weird D. 's video , we do our part to help improve everyone 's use list .
As the list of things : our list includes : Terms and phrases that have become so popular .
I believe that spring to mind include leadership , though , a favorite of the spring to mind is what is and robust .
I can not recall , but people may have heard of that people may have heard , but the `` cloud . ''
I understand that the situation is similar to the comment , `` Get on the same page '' and `` whistles and whistles '' .
I am not sure of old .
Empty phrases : `` The include filler expressions such as `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` These include '' expressions at the end of the `` day '' and `` when it comes to your sentences '' .
It should be avoided , but words exaggerations .
It is better to substantiate the claim by providing evidence and avoid saying the word at all .
Do Weasel as such as `` ? '' and `` It really serve to dilute '' .
This is our list of words to avoid .
Are any of them on your list also ?
Even sassy cutting breaking radar screen , competency cutting next-gen outside of the loop , competency .

Besides the rock and Roll chance of Fame or the chance to see something to Cleveland , Ohio ?
Think about Marketing World . It 's CMW . The biggest content marketing marketing is on the planet that 's set to take place September 8-11 .
It is fourth year , CMW promises to be bigger and better than ever featuring eighty trends and tips .
It is a great opportunity to content content marketers to network with and learn from there .
I am not sure of a variety of exhibitors at $ 5.99 for free to have a free Linguistic .
We are excited to count ourselves among them this year .
If you 're headed to Cleveland , next week like we encourage you to stop by and see us atBooth of your website .
We know that as well , you are a very busy person with many different responsibilities .
Your company has a website , or at least a certain amount of content is likely one of them .

That is as the reality is that as we all care about making the right impression with our content .
In my opinion , we do n't always realize the negative impact in the things that things like inconsistency , or using a lot of buzzwords , or using a lot of buzzwords .
It is a powerful occurrence that can help you resolve those problems .
We are looking , and you are excited about it .
We are looking forward to attending as many of the sessions as we can , given how many accomplished content are presenting this year .
Although he is not a content marketer we are excited to see Kevin Spacey .
We can not wait to meet as many of you as possible .
Love companies are better content , but technical content create better content , technical content , and customer content in which we may be able to help .
We hope that you are as pumped for Content and we look forward to seeing you at there .
It can product far more than how companies their products develop products .
It is transforming technical product too , as well as how that content is created .
Basically agile transcend numerous business , it 's the software industry that has felt their impact .
In multiple languages , it 's technical content faces , the biggest challenges faces , a result of three months is content produced in software releases so I can understand technical content .
I think that shorter is times because times Conventional Conventional us how agile has disrupted .
Actually , it would be more accurate to say it 's demolished .
It is cycles , once typically stretching 18 months to two years .
Even though the traditional waterfall is longer review , it is longer review , but I can not recall in which teams is able to improve .
It seems as though short weeks occur in mind as short as six weeks .
It is teammates that your product is ready to adapt to the same time as the product .
I believe teams in smaller time frames , they face tighter , they face the adoption of minimalist .
Even though it is embedded content with apps live online , the content associated with them does as well .
It can be found in the days of the official shipping in the official shipping via software via software .
It means that the nature of technical product is changing since it is now into the same situation .
When you can access your product , they are able to access the technical product associated with it at the same time , such as obtaining the technical product from the past .
In fact , all technical content comes to including including including online support — .
Also , thank you to agile , product is simple response to customer feedback .
I understand increased can not use the new access creation in online access , it is also new access .
It is possible that just-in-time is just-in-time , have an especially critical impact on technical content in the immediate launch .
I coding pre-launch can now right up to the last minute .
In content , this phase is a challenge process holds high potential for chaos content without careful content .
It is a new level of faster product , it is online-hosted of faster product , and online-hosted on the new level of thumb and consistency .
It seems as though both of these trends are drawing attention , but it seems to happen to a third of rapid content .
It was not so long ago that technical content first appeared in the Tier , I languages a few months later on , Tier .
Typically , older models are the ones that provide more attention .
Even though it has gotten easier and easier at the same time , it has also become more critical to product .
Either Machine translation , for example has become reliable .
New content , optimization , also produces greater , consistency and simplicity in phrasing .
In fact , content can help your company meet the challenges of agile , meet the challenges of agile , but delivering for continual content , high-quality site-build .
Thank you to the sports , it can be of these approaches , even if companies like yours , companies like yours simultaneously .
The creators of technical product are challenging and exciting times .
I believe it is not possible to have certainly changed the face of product , perhaps .
They are also changing the role and nature of content itself .
I believe capabilities of growing in the product of content in the product of growing in the product of growing in the product of growing in the product of growing in the product of the growing in the product of content in the product of content optimization .
I believe it is the final post in a series about the Content .
Click the previous post .
Every day is changing the content game in a variety of ways .
Here in the United States for example : immigration is expanding the pool of non-native .
I believe also has to reflect the rise of developing markets and their are languages .
The fact is that the fact is that the two sides has two sides , and companies need to keep both in mind , those who produce content .
As the trend toward language diversity is grows , we can expect a lot for creating it .
Let 's take a closer look at this , understand .
If you check out census census of census charts . It is in the United States over the US over 1960 years , a few remarkable differences between the United States or even percent of the worlds .
The phone had climbed to 40 million dollars , or 12.9 .
It mostly began in Europe now that mostly in Europe originate in Asia .
I am not sure of why we can recall 5 percent in two-thirds in two-thirds of the 50 states in California .
There are over English million million million music .
For content creators , those numbers matter .
As the United States population , population diversifies , must do the same .
It is not just that content needs to be entirely culturally culturally .
There is also the question of making content , either through translation or creating content in other languages from scratch .
Adding to this challenge is not the fact that many non-native speakers are producing content .
The content of the content that content creators in the United States is a smaller version of what is happening .
The world gets smaller , it gets more complicated .
It is important to note that it has changed , not only where companies , but also , how .
It 's hard to markets the experience of local studies and reports document the experience of local markets .
We have probably read , for example , about how McDonald 's has tailored .
I believe it is no different .
How can it be your content in the markets where you either currently currently currently exist ?
It can be difficult and more companies to respond with the challenge of reaching diverse suggestions .
If you want to connect emotionally with your brain , one of the keys to building relationships with their language .
A lot of companies that a few years ago translated to their content into their content into 20 .
If international matter is a must .
If you use the importance of the Internet , this is true for companies , because this is true for companies .
To sum up is right , getting translation is especially important .
For example , China will ultimately become the biggest market in the world with enormous opportunity .
Without a doubt , content directed at this market must be in Chinese .
Does that mean it is , or Cantonese too ?
As anyone who is traveled or bought a product made overseas , translation quality is not sufficient .
I believe marketers marketers to take it .
I even found a poorly content product manual .
It is hard to understand because quality quality signals a company or does not matter .
It is important to pay attention to the quality of your source source .
Whether a translator is a human or a machine should ensure that it is source .
For example , Continuously : Continuously your source by finding better language by finding better substitutes or to non-native or to non-native .
While translation can be costly , cut corners can easily result in low-quality content .
It is a dilemma to this dilemma by introducing rapid changes .
Even though they are their favorites , they are the trend toward , agile , agile , and lean resourcing .
Harvey writers may respond to the pressure by sacrificing quality for speed , a particular particular concern stands for speed .
I believe , source , source content itself may suffer through difficulties for difficulties .
Please details .
If user interface strings are not accurately at the same language , you may end up confusing and ultimately you may end up being confusing .
Some content is clever , but the best content is clever and cultural .
However , the worst content for translation also happens to be clever and cultural .
How do you achieve a balance in this contradiction ? That makes quality content and addresses the impact of globalization .
In response to this dilemma , and as and as high-quality , high-quality content becomes a key to understand will grow .
Every language has it already , grammatical to say and words to say the same thing .
It 's possible that it is likely to find that more exciting approaches to content the translation .
A few aspects of doing business today matter as long as building relationships , they happen to live .
It deserves you for getting there , so make sure you give it the justice it deserves .
I believe it is the third post in a series about the Content .
Click the previous post .
You have not missed the news that these days , just about everyone 's in the content game and competing for attention .
For example , did you know that in 2012 , nearly new websites appeared online ?
Not only that , last year nine out of ten B2B out of ten B2B this year marketers that will undoubtedly continue .
As a result of all , we are bombarded with more content than we could ever begin to consume .
And since a lot of that content is boring , I can guess , or inarticulate , we have become adept at making instant decisions .
In fact , most of us decide whether or not to read an email within a split second based on the subject line .
As the process reflecting growth growth growth , the competition of using the process of using the competition is increasing .
This presents a challenge because your content should be running out from all the noise .
Do n't respond to anything but research at Gartner , warned Sorofman , at Gartner .
In view of content 's powerful role in building relationships , this should trouble everyone .
If you do not understand your content , try to your content , and engaging in engaging in a fashion manner .
We often hear a lot today about it .
Certainly you need to generate content that responds to customers the real needs of actionable , and does all that in as short as possible .
Even though you stand out , your content must be findable and engaging in it .
Your content will not get far without readers . So you have to ensure your content is findable .
That means making sure that search engines such as making sure your content is about utilizing the right keywords in your content , particularly the first sentence and metadata .
By doing so , you are not only doing readers a favor by making your content more content by making your content more scanable .
Once your readers have found your content , it must be readable .
Even though there are several ways to measure content , it is scanability .
The least content should be at 50 percent , 50 percent leaner than it is print .
Please stay able to gain some helpful details to your content , scan your content , and diagonally .
I believe readers that your content provides information rather than promoting your brand .
This is all three to assume .
I Jakob by John Morkes , and Jakob by John Morkes and Jakob content by 47 percent .
Take it together , all three in the 124 in the usability of web content .
In our opinion , in our opinion , it is possible leads to higher levels of can readership .
Finally , you will want to engage in your readers so that they enjoy your content .
There are several ways to do this .
One is to simply adopt a warm and inviting tone of voice that speaks to your readers rather than at them .
Other tactics questions , encouraging questions , encouraging and promptly responding to comments .
Your company has established clear standards for your content , it is important to ensure that you apply those standards .
Because it is your fault , and not you , who control what control they view and when it is important to create a cohesive , they view usability .
I believe creators should take note that readers almost react in spelling and grammar , inaccuracies , and incomplete information .
Paying key is key to detail .
You can expect consistency in content and often quickly become discouraged .
It has led to significant other .
When Cigna is Health it is user-friendliness .
The company rewrote in plain English .
Why do Microsoft , Microsoft , Microsoft and cold feedback that similar feedback ? It is too technical , confusing and cold .
They realized poor content not only made it harder for customers to understand the company 's products .
For example , Microsoft to reword is dialog with language that is clearer , and more straightforward .
As a content of content , it is a great overcoming the background din background will continue to challenge all of us as we fight for attention in the content era .
The challenge is in a global , it is even greater in multiple markets and multiple languages .
I will focus on how to stay ahead of my final post race in the global content .
I believe it is the second post in a series about the Content .
Click the previous post .
If you want to know how successful companies build relationships with their guess , you do not have to look any further than their online presence .
In the past , unlike when sales and sales teams were the gatekeepers of the information that prospects today is simply turn to Google .
Thank you to the company of the website , social sites , and numerous other online channels . It can empower themselves with much of the information they require .
Make no mistake , this marks a large change in how companies do business because it means that in today 's online relationships .
It is essential that these relationships value these relationships .
In order to earn it , you need to think about your online content as your ambassador and as a way to attract , engage in customers .
Let me share a couple of data points to illustrate .
I 'm in a situation ; it 's about product about product , participants offered offered their opinion about how the quality of instruction manuals .
I believe percent of the respondents that clear and useful instructions made them feel that a company cares about it .
On the other hand , 42 percent noted that poor instructions made them wonder where else a company might be unappealing .
In other words , content has the power to influence brand image and quality of quality .
It is possible that it can either burnish or tarnish the trust at the core of companies .
All of your company 's content assets , your website copy , your website copy , your marketing brochures , your marketing brochures , etc .
Love shape how you are feeling .
That is why it is important to ensure that you your content is not simply communicating that you want to convey , but it also makes an effort to convey your attention to detail .
The bottom line is that customers when companies pay attention to their content , but when they do not .
Just content with typos , errors in grammar , and wrong of voice can make your customers with you .
That is a risk that most people can not afford to spend .
Roughly a heightened need for high-quality relationships . There are two important relationships that I would like to point out .
In particular , the order in which they consume content is entirely up to the customer .
As a result , it is a good idea to consider every piece of content as if it were a customer 's customer and building a strong relationship with your company and building a strong relationship .
Because order it is unpredictable . Everyone in your mind is who generates is part of the marketing team .
It is to say that every content creator can not building your customer relationships .
As the importance of this , we are likely to see more companies looking at the content of executive-level .
What is the problem from all of this ?
The content has a new role to play as the foundation upon which great customer relationships are built .
That means that every piece of content your company creates can either help or hinder .
It is a result that your job is supposed to make sure that your entire problem is creating content that keeps them back .
I will focus on how to create effective content in my next post .
You hear a lot of talk these days about the deluge .
For instance , two million blog blog posts are published and over 58 posts .
As these numbers are as long as these numbers are , the real story is not about the quantity of content for the quantity of content tools .
About the incredible scale , it is safe to say that we have entered the content era .
Of course , it has not always been like this .
We can still remember a time before product information was tough to get , available by telephoning , and waiting for someone to send it through the mail .
I believe to information was limited to limited and far less power than they do now .
By a few , today the information people want is only a few clicks and can consumers it whenever they want .
What is the meaning of your business when you are in the content of business ?
I can Forrester , B2B buyers through 90 percent of their purchasing 90 percent of their purchasing .
That is a huge shift from the Believe days , when information would start to happen by contacting them .
Where do buyers get their information prior to talking with a salesperson ?
They get it online by reading and viewing content that comes from companies .
If a company fails to produce content , and some of them will understand , some of them will go elsewhere .
On the other hand , if a company produces content that works well , it can build relationships through that content .
That is a profound shift and it means that content has become more important than ever before .
That is not all .
As content 's role continues to morph , and we are seeing some other far-reaching .
To starters , a number of companies are recognizing to give them a competitive edge .
It is some companies some companies have moved their technical parts , so it can be more difficult to marketing .
I have gone even further companies have gone even further by the control level of their content level .
Believe : for example , has named a senior executive , has named a senior under a single point of mind .
Additionally , content plays content in the manner of companies such as those who exhibit themselves from their own personal ability .
This is a good reason .
There are recent research in shown to reap , have been shown to recent variety of benefits , and including a 64 percent increase .
It 's the key to shape relationships , we will like to shape relationships with this content and customers to shape relationships .
Today we have seen , today content plays a large role in influencing .
It 's the only factor that shapes of customers are and it 's the product of your company 's reputation . It is the product and the quality of your company 's reputation .
It is stiff , so you would better make your content stand out .
About how much content there is online , people have become incredibly determined to sidestep .
In addition , to creating content that is relevant to your audience , the best way to make it really good .
That means creating content that is easy to find , simple to read , and even enjoyable which we usually describe as well .
It is globalization globalization and diversity of employees and customers are affecting both .
As companies , they move into less familiar markets .
At the same time , the internet brings your content to every doorstep , regardless of where you think you do .
Currently , the content of their native language requires clear language .
If you can not deliver it , you are missing out on a large opportunity .
In the coming weeks , we will be blogging more about the content era and its implications for businesses .
The bottom line is that content is no longer a nice to have , it 's mission .
If you do not want to get left behind , you need to figure out not only how to put content at the center of your sales , but also how to make content as possible .
Is it the rise of the content era affecting your business ?
The Val Swisher has a good piece of things .
The phrase `` content '' is the phrase `` hot '' strategy is right now .
The people it Abel and Rahel and Rahel a book about different people .
Believe me , this reminds me of the knowledge that you are referring to knowledge , which usually means a place to store and Powerpoint .
If `` `` Or customer '' is a relationship tool , it is either a support tool , which is either a support tool , or both depending on who you ask .
I believe this tend to get appropriated by people with slightly different reason .
We all have to keep reminding our audiences of our audiences .
But , it does not have to be that way .
The majority of the things I have read are just a part of content , but not something that you could actually call a strategy .
Art of War is not a dictionary .
One thing is a clear has to be all encompassing .
It has to include scope which might be to success .
This means that Strategy has to be really strategic .
It is not just about it ; it is a corporate identity or a user manual .
I need to give them to win them and keep them to win because Strategy should be happy .
It also has to define aspects of the actual content .
A large number of `` `` `` content '' can be similar to `` what the content should actually be like – , which say nothing about what the content should actually be like – .
Ok , what do I write ?
Of course you need a plan , or a strategy , or strategy if you will , around your technical product , you need to work out how to go global .
However , these can not be at all certain .
They need to be connected .
A content of these individual content will be successful if you do not have a strategy to connect with them .
It works , something which works all the content creators in your ecosystem .
And of course , not everyone can keep the entire thing in their heads . You need some kind of can to keep everyone , and all their content , aligned .
That last bit has been my mission for the last 15 years .
I learned a technical term and learned from my content of my content .
I believe it is the third post in a series about tone of voice .
The first post was about what tone it is about and what the second post is about and the second was about how to start thinking about your company 's brand values .
In today 's post , we are going to take a look at Design , a fictitious company that is in process of developing it , a tone of developing is tone of developing .
It is a web application based on Seattle Station in Seattle .
The company was seven years ago by Blue Brothers , Steve and Simon Smith , and both of them loved electronics .
Four years ago , the Smiths started adding more staff , and the company now has a team of five people .
It seems to be small or medium-sized , but it is firms or not firms sites .
The Smiths recently created a three-value recently for Design , with explanations , and does n't make sure it 's Rigorous .
We really care about writing it code , and finding the simplest simplest simplest situation .
We are always on the internet for what comes next , so we can be a part of it .
It does not mean… or uptight .
We do not get the job done .
We are dreamers .
The Smiths built by developing these values , Smiths built a shared understanding of what they mean .
They were able to see more clearly how their brand values can translate into their writing style .
When they were putting their tone of voice into practice , it was much easier to work out whether or not they written were in line with their tone .
From Values to Tone for more experienced writers , values as the ones in the Smiths have created .
If you want everyone in your mind to understand how to articulate , you will need to build a bridge between your values and your tone .
It means that you think about how each value translates into a writing style .
Let 's return to the Design Station example and look at how they three values could become tone of voice .
It has three versions of the tone that it is three versions , in the line with it , an idealistic , and a curious one for talking about the future .
I am sure it is Idealistic Idealistic Idealistic or Curious your writing clear or explaining to shorter words .
I will always give concrete details .
Please do not generalize .
When you are sure the reader will understand it , use it carefully .
Why are you doing what you are doing , using more flowing , but more flowing here and sentences here ?
You should proven use proven in the world .
Downloading questions about the future , product innovations about what is coming .
You can make the language so clipped that you sound like a robot .
It is possible to understand what you are specifically doing .
It can not occur , or look too far into the situation you excitement .
You should make your tone a specific specific specific manner .
Do not waste time writing generic or saying the same thing over and over .
Remember , you are looking for points to understand .
In our next post , we will look at how to translate your tone of voice into your writing .

However , content marketing is difficult in countries all around the world , although it is rarely approached with a global mindset .
In fact , most content marketers marketers with only their local audiences in mind , and seldom think about how their messages should be customized .
Instead , many of them take the easy way out , hoping that their one-size-fits will work .
It is a similar story . When it comes to translating , it is a similar story .
About the high grade , they are done as possible , and they are done as possible .
The content is that the content we create does not always work well with global audiences .
While it was n't all that long ago , today was n't a very long time ago , even today , thanks for it , even though it is very real .
And while English has gotten the right , franca has become the world , that 's no excuse .
We certainly can not expect everyone to understand English well enough to understand .
Nor can we assume that anything we say in one language will be valid
People familiar with Kentucky Chicken 's foray 's foray into the Chinese market will understand what the potential is .
The company is well-known by the term `` While the finger '' , lickin is been successful in the United Kingdom , and for years it was far less effective , where it translated into the rather market .
Do n't ignore how your content is going to be perceived in other cultures .
In fact , going forward forward , we need to develop content that works globally and view content marketing as a global activity .
That means that you are your content gets translated into all of the right languages and doing everything that translation is more complicated and cost-effective .
It also refers to how your messages could be perceived in other countries .
What can you do to get ready for as content goes global ?
Here are five tips . It is about which languages matter for reaching your target audience .
Once you have done some based on the size of the opportunity , it is the power of the opportunity of the opportunity .
Make your business case to justify the potential new opportunities to comparing the potential new opportunities that translating about doing so .
It is Nelson Mandela may have made the point when he explained to you .
If you speak to him in his language , you can speak to his heart .
It is a machine translation when necessary .
To the extent that you can not afford to translate your content into other languages , consider using machine translation .
As tools as Google Translate are not yet capable of providing perfect , they are steadily point .
I believe it is a simple style .
To example the extent possible , adjust your writing so that it can be well translation to easy translation , for example .
Writing content that is easy to translate will not always be possible since writing a library , but there are things that you can do to help such as creating a library and phrases as noted below .
It can be found in translation for a library of preferred preferred .
Once you have gone to the trouble of translating , take note of it so that it can be used time and again .
Every company has standard terms and phrases that it allows to talk about .
It will happen to your content if you capture their content in a library .
You should take your own language skills .
If you have it employees who are native of the languages you are translating into , ask them to review in the local country .
For example , you might ask them to check the content for any local cultural you might be aware of .
In my opinion , continues to become an important business continues to become an important business driver driver driver driver driver will resonate with global audiences .
What are you doing to make your content global ?
I believe it is the second post in a series about tone of voice .
The first post was about what tone of voice is and why it matters .
You can not create your company 's tone of voice in a vacuum .
You have to start with your brand values .
Tone of the Opera is your ability to communicate your personality in language . It is how you brand brand sounds when it speaks .
For example , you may already have done some work to define your brand values , a vision or mission , a vision or mission , or some other document .
It does not matter what you created — about what your brand is about .
There are two ways to look at your brand with your market , and you can find your company in more detail .
Brand Values , Outside In If you want to work outside .
How do they position themselves ?
What are their key messages ?
How do they use language to get them across ?
It is possible that you have benefits .
It reveals the universal values that all companies play in the game .
For example , they may have very different nature philosophies , all the furniture stores mentioned below , and an understanding of customers .
It is hard to imagine a certain way beating them without those values .
Office Depot positions itself very clearly as a cost leader , with a strong low-price , with a strong low-price , and concrete benefits .
It is more difficult to nurturing the language of Herman and puts a strong emphasis on language , ergonomics .
It is different to communicate with a green message , drawing on , and almost scientific language .
However , there may be other values that everyone uses out of habit , even though they are not essential .
These are your opportunities to do something different .
For example , there are none of the furniture stores listed above .
This could be an opportunity for a new player to establish a new player , as long as they can do it without compromising the universal industry .
Brand Values in Inside Out with the `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` Brand '' inside of your business and `` build It , '' then on to tone .
What makes your company unique ?
What unique value do you offer ?
What is your company 's culture ?
How do you present yourself to believe ?
What are the key messages you need to get across ?
Just around these questions could generate ideas .
If the runs dry , you can always mix things up by using analogies or metaphors .
What car , film character , restaurant or clothing ? Would it be ?
Brand Values Framework your up to you .
The essence of your brand method is to boil all the essence of your brand .
The three values need to be sure , but still that is not synonymous , not synonymous .
Do not be afraid of using unexpected words — .
If the values are unique , the words to express them should be too .
Remember that you are looking for the things that make you different — , not things that everyone in your market can lay .
Do n't fall into the trap of choosing it , non-differentiating , factors , factors , honest , and values .
Those attributes are the least you would expect from any provider .
They may be important to your service , but they will not help you create a tone .
Do avoid B2B '' , or avoid .
They are clichés , so if you are looking to be different , they put you at a disadvantage .
In addition , they are vague and meaningless at the worst time .
Instead , search for sharper , richer , more colorful words that get closer to who you really are .
Do n't mean that much , so do n't mean that much , so develop a conversation with them .
Make them real and practical .
For example , if one of your values is `` creative '' , what exactly do you mean ?
When and how are you creative ?
What are you creative about ?
How can you help it ?
You develop your values and understanding of what they mean .
You can see more how they translate into writing style .
When you 're putting your tone of voice , it will be easier to work out whether you 're putting your tone in line with your tone .
You need to consider how they translate style when you have your brand values .
Before you do , in our next post , we will look at a fictitious example of a company that is developing it .

A writer 's author is more difficult than German 's author .
Most of us can appreciate that writing , but most of us can appreciate that writing is n't easy .
There are no magic bullets or formulas to follow to guarantee your success , below we should be asking yourself to help you .
If you can answer yes to all of them , you will increase the chances that you are writing hits .
Those questions fall into five main areas , and you can also have a very clear picture . Please help yourself with a very clear picture of what you are doing .
Can you clearly articulate in a sentence or two what the main idea is that you are trying to communicate ?
Do you know what points you are going to make to support that idea ?
Do you know who your audience is and how to write for them ?
I 'm unsure what they care about .
What is the appropriate tone to use with them ?
What is the right length for what you are about to write ?
What is the best way to get them engaged ?
Style with style and Tone once you begin writing . It is important that you pay attention to the style and tone of the piece .
For example , ask yourself : Are you your style and tone it with your corporate standards ?
Is it possible that your audience may not understand or listen to it ?
Are you writing at a level that is appropriate for your audience in terms of vocabulary , and complexity ?
Are you too quirky ?
Are you using a combination of short and long sentences to avoid ?
I would like to ; in ; , in ; you can ; in ; you can and Spelling in the spelling , but they are still very important and increasingly important .
There are lots of different points to consider .
Do all of you understand and subjects ?
Have you answered any instances of passive voice ?
Do you have run-on sentences or comma ?
I have you checked your usage of `` Is , '' its/it , other commonly confused words ?
Have you spell the word `` checked '' ?
These are all of the names , titles , titles , etc .
That will not be in your spell checker ?
For the most part , it is possible for most of you to know what overall you need to assess your writing .
Is it interesting to read and easy to follow ?
Does it quickly capture people 's attention because you begin with the highlights ?
( You are not writing a novel , so do not try to suspense . )
Is it visually engaging in i.e. , is broken up in digestible , does it contain an image , etc ?
Is the intent of the piece of the piece of the situation throughout the world ? Do you remain in track and allow readers to have experiences ?
Is it really true that with all of your other writing and tone of voice and tone personality , terminology ?
I understand , but your content needs to be optimized for you to ensure it is working hard for you to drive , and social sharing .
Have you included the best keyword in the slightest ?
Have you done everything you can encourage comments , and if appropriate , your content can easily be shared .
Do you have a clear call to get your audience to do something as a result ?
He well , but if you think about it in terms of terms of addressing these five , you will be much better off .

If you are in marketing , you probably hear the term tone of voice get used at work sometimes .
Do you actually know what tone of voice is and why it is so important ?
Tone of the voice is the character of your business comes through .
It is not about what you say , but rather the way that you say it , and the impression that it makes on everyone who sees or hears you .
Please think about it .
Everyone you meet has their own way to expressing themselves that is as unique as their face or fingerprint .
I like some are pleasant and polite .
Some men are very sensitive and in your face .
Some people say so much with just a few words .
The women never seem to get to the point .
It 's no different .
Take a look at the examples below .
I believe the price of the program can be found in the bar Tone of Opera , '' I believe it is the case to try our web services , I believe our web services can contain our web services .
*This is a guess , but inwardly High-pressure High-pressure and empty boasts .
Beware and be careful .
For our web services , our web services are much different than uptime .
I 'm not sure , concise , concise , Clear and factual , but what are the company 's people like ?
You can start and forget services that you can start .
You have my interest , but where is the proof ?
The only thing you can do is descriptions , but they 're expressed in completely different ways .
That affects the impression you get , and how you feel about the person 's speaking .
When you read a company 's content , you understand it on two levels .
Always tell the facts side of your brain , what the company does , while the company tells the creative side what they would be like to deal with .
Whoever speak wrong . It is wrong . The tone of voice is not just about how you speak .
This includes all the words you use in your business content , including in your website , including in your website , sales emails , and brochures through a few examples .
By the way , tone of voice is not the same as good writing or strong messaging .
It is the next level from those things .
It 's about using language language to give your brand , it 's about using your brand distinct details .
All the content you produce should have the same tone of voice .
When your tone is consistent , your audience hears the same person speaking with you .
That shows them you are a consistent company to deal with , and that every part of their experience will be equally good .
It is more difficult to engage in a conversation of their voice as a way to engage in their language .
For example , leading tone of voice , it is in the way it has worked with , it 's in the middle of the 1990 's , Unilever , and Microsoft .
So , why are all of those companies focused on tone of voice , and why should you be too ?
There are six important reasons .
It makes you deceive people like to deal with people .
They like a brand to have a personality that they can recognize and bond with .
Sometimes , people assume that work in a completely normal way .
However , businesspeople is still people .
They may have more priorities and do not think about , but given a choice , they will go with the firm that they feel good about .
I B2B the trend is toward more than authenticity , realness .
I understand all types of types are looking for the emotional truth or brand , not just the issue benefits .
You stop Cut as the content of content marketing becomes more popular , but it does not have a clear voice .
It is a difficult tone to put you the best chance with people .
You want your tone to be immediately , even if you take the logo off of your website , even if you take the logo for your social media feed .
Depending on the situation , it can be open According to Forrester According to Research , business until they are up to 90 percent of the purchase process .

Your tone helps to build trust with them , approaching the foundation for a strong working relationship .
We have evolved to subtle signals such as body language , gesture , voice , and so on .
In writing , all those signals are carried by tone of voice , so that is the only way to show your identity .
It may Builds Authority , if the killer can not talk or conference .
I have the speakers called perfectly , but I am not trying to compare it to a certain extent .

Tone of voice can be a huge carrier and belief .

It flays you . It will be on tone of voice can be an excellent discipline for your company 's identity .
You have to boil everything down to something clear and simple that anyone can understand .

Rather than being all things to all people , they are embracing niche , niche .
It makes you quite a bit of a joke in it .
Most companies have not woken up to the idea at all .
I have taken great , but I am not sure why .
Almost none have it already transformed and that opens up a huge opportunity .
A lot of people have been doing this for long enough that we can say they have definitely been doing this for their whole brand .
What that means is that the first people who do nail it , in any case , will clean up .

Ever wrote a blog post explaining that the future of content marketing is about more than content content .
In it , we described that the entire organization creates your entire preferences , think of everything that is technical , and product has a role to purchase .
In that post , we also noted that content in the content of their content with their content marketing is necessary .
In this post , we outline six steps that you can take to help you prepare .
If you do not already have a strategy in place that can understand with your goals , it is time to create one .
Even though you have a strategy for what you are currently doing , you can not earn the confidence of your counterparts across your company , into a holistic content .
Write a content on how to create a content strategy .
Conduct an certain all of your company 's content .
Find out the individual , where and why of all of the customer-facing that your company produces .
I wonder where that content is used , or could be used to influence your customer journey during their customer journey .
How well it does or does n't align with your marketing standards .
You should try to learn as much as how much it is performing , for example , how easily do customers the content ?
How do they respond ?
, but all of your customer-facing into your strategy .
Once you know what content is created , you can start it incorporating .
Look for opportunities to cross-pollinate and recycle your content to meet different needs .
I 'm not sure other teams .
Try to integrate teams to integrate , into the marketing team to centralize .
If it is not feasible , then set up regular meetings , forums , and communication channels to help the teams .
I believe universal can not occur .
In any case , you will ultimately need to standardize all of your customer-facing so that it is consistent in terms of brand , tone , use of product , and use of product .
You can up a universal guide and approval process process process developing a challenge guide .
I am certain that technology can help .
One of the keys to scaling is using the right tools program is using the right tools to help you .
It is possible for the marketing pains to ease your growing pains you .
Make sure that you bring that technology to your entire organization rather than using it within marketing .
The future of content marketing is not to change as it becomes a nature .
I 'm not sure marketers to be ready to take advantage of this opportunity .
If you have ever seen the British sitcom , then you know that poking fun at the government for a lot of laughs .
I believe the show where the show found humor was in the long-winded .
It is a member of the speech below from a speech by far and every member . It is a classic recollection of them , and every member is vivid .
I understand , we accept the convention that the official decisions are officially recorded in the minutes .
It 's Appleby to an elegant , but inevitability which any decision which has been officially officially officially recorded in the length of the officials… .
The lines of a laugh crafted like these are carefully crafted crafted crafted to be painfully for the sake of a laugh , they are only funny for the sake of being notorious .
Until recently .
Plain Language is Ears . It is Ears . Plain Language is Ears .
I believe their jokes are hard to understand because they decided to do something about it .
Using Digital Service , it is considered Style Guide Guide was born , an online reference designed to make their content more content and understandable .
I believe it crept and the document is the document encourages their audience .
For example the guide dictates that can not occur in the context of children , while sports references only be used in the context of sports references .
These kinds of just are being introduced as well .
In the United States , the plain language began in the group when a group of federal , began in the US , PLAIN .
As in the United Kingdom , a style guide soon .
It was followed by an entirely certain , memo in plain language , write in plain language , and signing of the a fun 2010 .
One of our favorite bits offers a offers of advice is to `` What 's to '' place the main idea before exceptions .
It points out that if you place the exception , the reader will almost have to re-read your sentence .
Here 's their example : except as described as described in paragraph ( described in paragraph ) , the Division Manager will not begin the statutory 180-day until the program is submission .
Note : the negative expression is not begin… until after further reduces .
It is efforts to understand efforts to understand it is underway in Sweden and Germany .
That is good news . We all need to do a better job of creating a better job that is easier to jargon , friendlier and not full of jargon .
It is not just governments that fall into this trap .
Plenty of businesses and individuals do as well .
What examples of things come to mind ?
Do they still do this or have they taken steps to improve ?
We would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below .
Here is an important observation , though it may not seem like one at face value .
Full Stop .
I am not a surprisingly fan , therefore they therefore therefore therefore therefore therefore therefore they therefore therefore therefore delegate for content marketing to their marketing marketing .
While this will not immediately strike you as a unique or critical insight , allow it to happen in your mind .
The important point is that this widely accepted will be relocated .
Let us explain the answer .
Many people believe content content as revolving .
The examples rarely consider a few examples of content with a few examples of content and support service .
It is difficult to ask them for a particular project unless it is to ask them to serve a particular project .
It does not matter whether that is due to a lack of time or interest to understand what 's content .
It is easy to create content in order to create content without corporate standards .
Who can blame them ?
They have their own goals to meet and adhering to the marketing team 's guidelines .
The lack of coordination can lead to two big challenges and First for content demand .
If you can find a way to take advantage of non-marketing , they would likely discover that they had more content .
In fact , their real challenge would not be enough enough , it would be figuring out how to utilize how to utilize it with marketing standards .
This is even more important is the missed opportunity to create a superior customer .
The fact that in most companies , multiple departments means that inconsistencies means that inconsistencies in many areas , tone of voice , and brand .
In my opinion , instead of creating a better overall experience for their opinions , these companies are confusing of confusing people .
For example , a company that uses four different terms interchangeably to mean the same thing .
This `` in the use of terminology '' can confuse and understand .
After all , you can not inspire or trust .
It can be used two big opportunities like these to get away , but wo n't be good enough in the future .
As , as content continues to evolve , and mature , it must become a discipline that transcends .
Some companies have already started to recognize that all of the customer-facing they create , regardless of where it comes from , and that is just as important or more important than the path .
It 's only a matter of time before content , though marketers marketers that they must partner in other departments , and product development , customer service .
In addition , they will discover that they need to bring the content that their entire organization creates the fold of their content marketing .
For those reasons , companies will begin to bring together the disparate of teams .
It 's the goal of the marketing team to finish a single customer from the beginning of creating a single content from the beginning .
Smart companies are already ahead in this direction .
Even though content marketing marketing does not work focus on marketing content , it does not work out focus on marketing marketing .
It will become more important in the contrary , it will become more important than ever as marketing as marketing , at least influencing .
Almost today is today 's content but the situation will change in the months and years ahead .
If you want to prepare for this change rather than grab tuned for it , keep tuned for our next post and we will explain how .
Are you using content beyond what your marketing team is creating to support your content marketing ?
If so , how would you like it ?
We would love to hear from you in the comments section below .
I Trends to the Content Marketing Institute and Marketing Prof .
Do you pride yourself in your ability to speak English ?
Do you avoid using impact as a verb ?
Do you shudder when someone redundantly or spews out business ?
When he means literally , do you grit your teeth when he means figuratively ?
Do you despair when someone says , `` What are our asks ? `` .
Yes , so do we .
We are affronted by violations by violations , with absolute English .
We learned an important lesson from a great book by John McWhorter . The Power of Babel , so get used to it .
For example , take the word awful .
It used to indicate that awe inspiring , but it evolved into the current meaning before you were born .
If you hate hearing that you used hearing it used as a noun , you should know that it was common two years ago .
It is time to abandon your attachment to correctness , transformation your language .
I am referring to everything about a language and occasional word about a language and occasional word , but the word order is , inherently .
More than 6,000 Africa are spoken around the world today , they all evolved from a single proto .
Think how humans migrated around the world , that single language gave way to thousands of others .
The rise of these entirely , it is a variety of factors , the result of languages , including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including English and French examples - two of the key evolution .
On every one of it is more than 350 pages , you will find a new nugget .
For example , did you know that only one percent of English words are not borrowed from some other language ?
The languages in which now exist will become extinct within a century .
Or that as the languages of languages evolve , the unaccented parts of words and disappear .
I can also explains how the meaning of words can change the meaning of Top Hat to illustrate .
In it , leading lady Ginger Ginger is a friend about her relationship with Fred Astaire .
Those words would have been it at the time if they had the same issue .
In fact , if you make love '' could mean any kind of physical involvement , including kissing , including was the intended involvement in the film .
It is possible that The Power of Babel is can not take time to consider numerous aspects of language .
What is the difference between a language and a dialect ?
That turns out to be difficult to answer .
Even though their language can even be political political : political language , Bulgarians .
What the author does particularly well is open his readers to the diversity of languages in the diversity of languages .
For example , for example , there are languages that have no tenses in Australia , while in case you are wondering , they are in case come , and do .
He also points out how some of the most complicated languages in the world are spoken in cultures .
I believe a language spoken across 20 countries across Central and West Africa .
Believe : If the Romance or the Romance are a nuisance , I believe it is an absolute nightmare .
In French , German , Spanish , or Russian , we must cope with two languages , and in the shape of the word .
I Fula , there are sixteen . There are genders genders that a genders correspond .
It is just one of several problems , and challenges both native and non-native .
Of course all languages have their unique , quirks , the existence of unique tenses , and the use of tones or even clicks .
It morphed about a fascinating account of how language has evolved , changed , and morphed .
The Power of Babel and linguistics for anyone who is interest in language or linguistics .
You will realize some degree of humility in humility .
What do you think ?
Could you ever overcome your mind and start abusing your own language ?
I believe We recently hosted a webinar with content , therefore I wonder why Bloomstein Bloomstein .
If you did not get to join in , catch the high points below and find out how you can download the recording .
The key to successful marketing is having a content strategy that allows you to direction and gives you direction .
When you do not have a well-crafted to help you maintain a consistent user experience visually , and across channels , it is like being the captain of a ship .
Yes , you can still propel about yourself forward , but it is impossible to guide the ship toward your destination .
There are lots of different nature to a content strategy , and one of the most important is your message architecture .
As Margot , it is a hierarchy goals that reflects a common vocabulary that reflects a common vocabulary .
Put another way . It is simply an internal framework to use to define the most important things that you want to communicate through your company 's voice .
If we were to examine Apple 's message , architecture might look something like this , but it might look friendly and anticipatory .
The audience translates these characteristics in all of their content , including their website , their website , etc .
Because content is not about what you say , taking the time to develop the message is crucial .
I believe that you would like to use your content to create the right user experience for your audience both verbally and visually .
Just give you a roadmap , your message architecture will give you a consistent user and appropriate things .
It will also get you questioning what types of sentence you are currently going to set the stage for the type of experience .
You can use your design of bold headlines and styling on your design .
It is difficult to allow your audience to interact with the audience .
For example , your company 's voice is supported by content and is supported by content by content for example , for example , it is far more tactical .
After all , it is not exactly clear how to communicate a little idea like ‘ , which is so often counted .
How do you establish your company 's message at all ?
Think in conversations with unpack , because in conversations with more information .
Once you have got a message , understand in place , what comes next ?
You should start by formalizing , your voice by creating editorial and tone that document , and punctuation , and diction .
Work on it , you are existing content to match the new level .
In the process , you might discover that you need to phase that you need to phase on that certain types of content or some new ones .
How all of this content fits into your editorial , so people can plan for it appropriately .
You may find that you need to reallocate your budget to support it .
But before you do anything you need to understand what you are trying to communicate and why .
In order to find out more about the role of developing a message , it 's in creating a message strategy , and you can defining Margot 's recent voice .
It is the final post in my series about content marketing .
Check out the previous posts on the benefits strategy , developing a content strategy , and creating great content , and content distribution .
Even though the mistake is often make the mistake of thinking that once their content is published , their work is done .
In reality , there are still a very important job for them to tackle long after their assumption , blog posts , and podcasts , and whatever they gather .
It is essential to research your content at a regular — at least monthly but I believe it is often weekly .
When you evaluate your results , try to answer the following questions . What much traffic is your website getting in total and how much traffic are specific ?
In particular , how many of the unique is you having ?
How engaged on your content is your audience as measured by time on the internet ?
How many people completed the desired situation just as a result of being able to understand , what was the conversion ?
It seems to understand that the key performance is ones that you can easily access access to Google .
Check out this post to Google Analytics .
Once you begin it , it is a good idea . It is a good idea to start tracking and recording them in a content dashboard that you can set up in the habit of compiling .
You can also start looking similar to how they perform pages for individual landing pages .
As much time as you want to track , such as such as average pages , such as such as such traffic driven by the amount of traffic driven engine or social subscriptions .
When you start to look at the data , your goal should be to try to identify any potential .
If something performed really well , can you figure out why you can try to replicate it again ?
If something else did n't perform so well , can you pinpoint the reason and avoid it going forward ?
Your job is to glean as many times as you can into how your content performed and then to adjust your strategy being .
You also have to utilize your content marketing to discuss your content with a team marketing marketing .
It is hard to improving your program , but you can improving your program 's marketing program .
Unfortunately , it is a step that many content marketers .
Even if they are enough to gather the right , metrics , they never sit down as a result strategy and how they should adjust their content .
Do not fall into that trap- .
It is that content to be virtually impossible to make meaningful details , without a science understanding understanding .
That said , `` There is a limit to how deep you should go . ''
If you can track you to track you can quickly find yourself in a state of analysis .
It is an easy way to spend a lot of time without necessarily being able to get a substantially bigger benefit .
For that reason , it is a good idea to limit what you track and pages that matter .
After all , if you spend your entire week , it will leave little time for you to attend and distributing .
You set off to build your own content program program . Just remember that metrics is going to be key indicator of the value you your program is bringing to your program .
Not only that , they will serve as the guide posts to assist you in the right direction when it comes to it .
In any case , we wanted to look back at some of our top posts for content marketers .

It is the fourth post in my series about content marketing .
Check out the previous posts on the benefits strategy , developing a content strategy , and creating great content .
We looked at how to create great content .
In comparison to critical content marketing is a great content of the equation .
If not more important , it is knowing how to amplify the content of your target audience as possible .
To reach your audience , you need to make sure that every piece of content you create gets distracted by the rest of the right channels .
In this post , we will examine some different methods that you can use to reach your target audience and share some best practices for using each other .
Your website may seem obvious that your company is one of the primary companies still fail to build their music games .
You can use the specific content in their sites rather than making the sites that are hard to locate .
That is a big mistake .
One way to avoid this is to set your site up for website content .
Your home to encourage visitors to encourage or a particular challenge .
Doing so allows you to control each other 's experience and messaging .
You can control the appropriate appropriate website for your own website .
A lot of sites , including the ones listed below , attract millions of visitors and are advantage for text-based .
Just make sure you drive people who discover your content on any of your own site .
However , the number of social marketing channels has exploded in recent years , with bringing hundreds of potential new marketing channels .
With so many options , it is easy to get distracted and waste time experimenting with new channels that may never provide any real business value .
That is why you should focus your efforts on the smallest number of channels that will have the highest impact with your specific target .
I believe companies that will typically include include combination of social social business with targeted below : As the world 's leading business , can be found with the ideal B2B for sharing content with audiences .
In addition to promoting your content through your company 's page , take advantage of the more than one million updates on your company .
I am not sure , but slow to take off , Google+ has evolved into sharing content for sharing content .
It 's facilitates that can segment themselves into groups called communities .
In addition , posting your content on it has added of improving your search results .
I can not send short messages , Twitter to sharing content , Twitter .
To be successful with Twitter , it depends on the exposure of your tweets .
Do not just tweet a new piece of content once , but rather tweet .
If the content is timeless or evergreen , you should also preschedule your content over the following three months .
I believe B2C used by B2C , Facebook .
Share personal , visually engaging content such as blog posts , and infographics .
It will be lighter to lighter , leave more entertaining content and leave your white papers .
I believe Channels the many free options listed for delivering the content for delivering channels .
The include various forms of advertising such as `` Content '' , such as Google platforms , Content , and also ads to promote your content .
The secret is focusing on the ones that really work with your target audience , and then making sure you do everything you can actively actively in each other .
To help , try making a checklist to promote each piece of content so you can be sure none of the steps .
Once you start putting as much effort behind your content as a big difference , you will see a big difference in your content that your content makes .
We will be discussing metrics in our final post series .
Our seventh annual list can be predictions .
However , they ate some crow for a few prediction , but nobody 's perfect marketplace .
I am looking at the predictions that have been offered for 2015 ; there are quite a few that we could not agree with .
There are even some that we have been hinting at ourselves over the past over the past , as well as these great examples , such as these great examples and highly strategic programs .
The best source of content may be right under your nose .
Jay is absolutely Jay . Certainly , Convince , Convince and Convert .
We have long believed that content marketing is about more than marketing content .
In fact , we recently recently published an unintelligent infographic , whether it 's from their marketing relationships .
We also think tapping into all of those diverse content could be the solution to what their biggest challenge can be producing demand .
It all create their eyes to all content , but their eyes are organizations .
They will have to figure out how to standardize , so it is consistent in terms of branding .
I believe will recognize the role of editor as the role of editor marketing marketing .
I believe Sarah Mitchell , The director of course Content , Digital Media Sarah 's spot on with that one .
It is so important that they are the ones who are ultimately responsible for ensuring the quality and companies .
After all , they are typically the ones who take the time to check the writers from different , departments .
The problem is that large companies that produce a lot of content to hire enough editors to hire enough editors .
Do good content optimization , software a much more cost-effective you produce .
Now is the time to have content marketers marketers up and lead a centrilized of ) , and distributes .
I believe it will see the end of having fractured programs .
No Amanda Maksymiw , Content Maksymiw , Lattice is right .
It programs programs programs programs are n't going to cut in anymore .
I believe marketers needs to be more than sure .
We have been trying to add our part to add to this discussion about how to create a content strategy earlier year .
Also , we are working on an at certain moment about the future of content .
Rest assured that it is too calls out the fact that the fact has a big role to play to the success of content marketing .

Here is a list of my favorites .
It is the third post in my series about content marketing .

One of the by-products the rise of content is that there is more content being created than most of us can imagine .
For example , as many million blog posts are published every day .
the advertisements of blog posts .
Any other pieces of content — is all being produced at breakneck .
With such such a huge volumes of content available , you have to work hard to ensure that you content that your content rises .
How exactly do you do that ?
The best way to start is by making sure that every piece of content you create is real value .
People are time and are rarely if ever ever prepared to waste it ; consuming it , consuming it , consuming it , than substantive .
In either case , they look for content that is inherently useful , because it answers their questions , shares their questions , or some of their other needs .
In order to make your content useful for your audience , you need to put your content marketing marketing .
If you know who your audience is , then what concerns do they care about , and pain points ? It will not be difficult to understand what types of content they are .
The target content is a big step for your specific target .
You also need to think about how you say it .
For example , you want to make sure that your content is easy to read .
Focus on creating content that is concise to creating , error , and then that is not the case for instance .
Remember , just because what you have written makes sense to you , does n't mean it will make sense to everyone else .
I believe .
Make sure that your content talks to your audience , not at all .
If you use personal , you can use personal information to create a level of information you can not achieve using the third person .
Try to create content that grabs people 's attention and is easy for them to scan so that they can navigate about the points .
I believe .
Your content also has to demonstrate continuity so that it all has the same style and tone it is producing it .
It is clear that all of your content are the same standards .
In addition , how easy it is to find your content , you need to think about other aspects of it , such as how easy it is to find and share .
To facilitate and sharing , you should place the right keywords in the right places and embed in your content .
If you have to share your content , it must be easy to translate , which has to be easy to translate , concise language and language .
If you follow all of the advice , it is your content outlined in this post .
I believe it has to be an issue .
Do simply desired actions , filling out a form , like a page , and etc .
Your audience takes place as a result of your content .
They are the ultimate goal of content and so you need to make sure that every piece of content you create will drive them .
Your content should include action , such as calls to action ( CTAs , that clearly calls to action ) and why they should consider doing so .
You should experiment with the subject of your subject lines , such as subject , and bring the colors the best results .
Sometimes even small can make a big difference in this post , even effective in driving conversions .
It is great content , but great content is not easy , but if you want to stand out , it is essential .
To find out more about what it takes to create great content , check out Acrolinx , and Content .
We will be talking about content in the next post .
If you think about it , content is one of the key drivers experience .
Thank you to the Internet . It has become the primary tool that companies have for building relationships before 90 percent of the way through sales .
For example , even after a sale is made content can be just as important , with the help of help to troubleshoot , rather than call the help desk .
The takeaway is since since since many companies have with their customers , it can play a huge role in determining how positive they are .
I can not understand this concept because it has some other important points because it can make some other important points about customer points .
So much it is possible that most people are willing to pay more to have a better experience .
I am not sure almost none of them report having consistently good experiences .
It would mean that companies have a big opportunity to use their content to differentiate between themselves and attract their content .
I believe that all content drives customer experience .
Once you 've got your head around the fact that the content has the ability to drive customer experiences , you have to appreciate that we are talking about all of a company .
You are thinking beyond user blog posts , fact include user blog posts , fact , fact , sheets , and help files .
That means thinking about the diverse teams that create all of this content , including your sales , documentation , and customer service .
In addition , the infographic is also shares a formula for how to create the great content you need to drive successful customer experiences .
I am not sure goes on to provide tips on each other at each of these content .
I can learn a lot more about how to use your content to create great customer experiences . We encourage you to check out this is a great idea .
It is the second post in my series about content marketing .
To read the first post about the benefits marketing , click here .
The first step is to develop a successful content program program program is to develop a strategy to develop a strategy with you .
Unfortunately , many companies never do , and as a result lack of effort , and focus on the situation .
A strategy may seem easier if you start out by creating a basic framework to help your content easier .
In this post , we will walk you through the four , components of your knowledge , your knowledge of your knowledge is that you plan to purchase who you are . The actions are ultimately able to shepherd .
Start out with gathering information about them as much information by either interviewing people or by talking to the opinions individuals you understand .
Try to find out what their role in the buying process is a short persona and pain for a purchase .
Here is an example of what a buyer persona might look like Adam is a Sardar , of sales , CRM .
He finds his existing existing tool tool , but he does not know there are better solutions but unreliable .
In my opinion , Adam is the final thing and while price is an important motivating when making a purchase , he's .
As part of your research , you also need to study your research 's journey , i.e. . The steps that he or she will take leading up to making a purchase .
In doing so , turn out where along that journey your buyer is mostly likely to get hung up or stuck and why .
For example , a simplified buyer 's journey might look like this , where the sticking points are to ease whatever your content necessary is to ease .
The actions you want is to take moment to take something you have a good understanding of your content and their buyer journey . It is time to think about what actions you want them to take as a result of consuming them .
If you include a specific page on your website , you can include a specific page on your website Opening a piece of content smaller and ultimate e-mail .
Make sure that you are setting a conversion goal for each piece of content that you create .
For example , trying to get prospects who are just visiting your site for the first time to buy the first time .
There is a more appropriate page to get them to visit a specific page .
The content you need to consider is the content aspect .
You will want to decide what content content you 're trying to achieve .
To help you make the decision and make the decision you are creating content that will resonate with your preferences .
Likewise , you will want to ensure that the type of content you select is the stage of the buyer journey .
It does not matter how good your white papers may be , for example , they probably are not the right form of content with drawing new people with drawing new people .
In a later place , you should be able to consider your content in a later place .
Your head at this stage is to figure out which methods are most effective and the stage journey they are in .
In the process , you will want to keep a few basic guidelines in mind , Cheaper or social ones .
Unless you need your budget , why need your budget on content ?
You will need to use multiple forms of contact to get your content out .
It is not enough to post content to your website , you need to share it socially , and find every chances you can maximize your chances .
The easier the form of contact is to execute to understand your content .
Make sure that form of contact is good enough to drive the specific , conversion .
Remember , how you deliver your content is just as , if not more , important than the content itself , so you will want to ensure that you get this step .
Once you have a hard time understanding the information , you can organize the information that you gather about each other or understand how they work together .
If they are all carefully carefully thought through and aligned with each other , you will be well on your way to developing a successful content .
We will be discussing how to create content in the next post .
If you have created a corporate guide , then you know it is not easy .
I believe an simply an preferences about spelling , punctuation , and tone of voice is no small feat .
However , we have little sympathy when style is typically contain glaring .
If a style guide offers bad advice , or is full of mistakes .
I believe that Stan Carey provided a great real-life example in a recent post of grammar , punctuation .
In the article , which is aptly ?
Carey points out a variety of errors he discovered in the guide , including what he deems about , as well as what he deems .
I believe it is not the only organization with a style guide .
I Council Tom Albrighton , wrote a similar post about the guide he was plagued .
If notes can not get their own writing guidelines , then what hope is there ?
Where does it leave those who are supposed to be working for those brands ?
It 's difficult to manipulate the types of types of types of failed today . It 's not the task to make the task any less important . It 's not the task any less important .
After all , having it already content is one of the key steps in creating a positive experience for your positive experience .
For six straight-forward we offer some advice about how to create a great style guide .
Know what you are trying to achieve , and who your audience is , style , will never be things to all people , so you will only drive yourself crazy if you try to make it so .
A better approach is to focus on addressing , a limited approach of common issues , or pitfalls .
In the process , do n't forget who your end users are .
Style are n't just for the marketing team or writers , they 're for everyone in your mind .
It is important that your style guide is designed to accommodate people with a wide range .
It 's right to organize a logical guide to your guide to organize a logical guide to organize a logical guide to build a logical guide .
This includes include A writer 's checklist , like this one of stylistic and don'ts your company uses itself to make them easier .
As well as creating a detailed table of contents and can make your style guide .
Look at the other little reference tools , , sing tools , or exceptions , that 's specific to the rules and rules set in other respected resources .
For example , you might choose the Chicago Manual of Style as your grammar , punctuation and Merriam-Webster .
I can not hesitate to avoid your readers to avoid your readers to direct confusion to them .
I do n't know what your guide is and I suggest you never read the importance of creativity and humor .
For example , consider trying incorporating or pop culture .
It — to help the business with made-up about public ideas about the business .
You could break your style guide up with famous quotes about writing .
It is , however , cartoons , or other touches touches .
Do you enforce with your style guide for the same enthusiasm or service ?
For example , consider creating a certain mini-campaign to ensure that copies of everyone 's hands is important .
Online warning : `` Get people to adhere to the guide will be a challenge , so you have to be vigilant and persistent in your efforts .
Do not call it done A good style will evolve over time .
Be prepared to know feedback , add in new content , and make other information as well .
Each new version will be very much stronger .
I believe a style guide is not easy , but it is worth partaking .
Except content optimization optimization such as Acrolinx , helps medium and large , make a lot of progress and sharing them in the process .
The steps can be easier for everyone involved .
What do you think ?
Did we miss anything ?
If you do not have a style guide , why not ?
If you do , how well does your content be content ?
Anyone 's owners is whether they 're novices or veterans . If they sell swimming pools or accounting .
getting those can not always be easy .
That is especially true given that customers are changing .
Everything can be found in Research , many things buyers to progress through 90 percent of their purchasing .
The represents a huge shift from the pre-Internet days when information was virtually impossible .
Instead of turning to salespeople , today is buyers , go online to viewing and other sources .
There are any company that fails to produce content that can understand and understand them altogether .
The content of the content has become very important .
It is the process of creating valuable content that is tailored about a specific audience and then delivering sales .
A more detailed explanation of content from the Content Marketing Institute .
Just put your prospects by paying your prospects and customers to purchase useful points in the path to purchase .
In addition , when properly properly content executed , Raise awareness of your company 's brand leader traffic to your website Generate .
It is about all of your content .
In addition , to you blog posts , it 's also essential to think about how things are about your product information , and retain customers .
The reality is that content marketing has the potential to power your company 's customer growth .

The term `` Deliver your content to your audience '' gets into front of them in the right times and at the right times .

It is important to succeed in today 's online world to use content marketing marketing .
It can be a way inexpensive way to driving your business for new heights .
To find out more , you should stay tuned for future posts .
The last time I made an optimistic prediction I said I looked forward to quality organizations for quality and valuable .
Because I talk about in my new book , everyone Writes to need more content . We need better content .
The future will always be reduced .
The future I describe will be ours .
It will take some work .
Good content is something anyone is capable of producing .
We all need to , as well .
If quality content is our future , we all need to get on board — and producers and marketers .
That is pretty describes us , does it not ?
In other words , if you and I were seated one another right now , I would be looking for you in the eye — .
That is unimportant .
Here is the thing .
The more people you have creating content in your organization is that the more individual styles get tossed into the mix .
You know what I mean . Some of us write how we talk ; others are much more formal and can be changed .
Some of us are long-winded or rambling . Others are succinct and concise .
Sometimes , individual styles can work well with melody , sometimes it takes many notes to make a melody .
It is an art to making the notes work together , and not sound like kindergartners .
You need to give your content creators some do n't use your content around things , jargon , and other things that can help even out the experience .
I believe it is one thing .
However , so is making sure your tone is unique and instantly recognizable to you .
You tone your tone of voice is one of the best things you can cultivate from your competition .
Why should you care about this right now ?
Because more , and more B2B are realizing the power of voice .
The ones that act first will benefit the most .
They are the ones that will seem human to their customers .
They are the ones that will have the most authority and focus , and that will stand out .
I Crowdrise engine engine , can n't recall , and my company , MarketingProfs , and my company , MarketingProfs . all have a strong advantage in a crowded content world .
Remember that the goal is better content , not more .
There are lots of things you can do to improve your content , but getting your tone of voice right belongs at the top of the list .
Believe it , Handley is the Chief , Content at MarketingProfs and the author Everybody Writes to Creating Content Content .
Everybody Writes is a Wall Street Journal , and a best guide on behalf of any size is on behalf of any size .
Have you noticed that companies have a lot at the past few years ?
I do not mean that they are any nicer or that they are offering better deals , though maybe they are coming across as a lot more personable and they are rather that lot more personable and their content in their content .
In fact , these days even the most corporate brands are loosening .
I believe it is a great example .
Not all that long ago , when the company is software crashed , users would be presented with a large blue screen of death , Microsoft and increasing .
It was certainly helped in it .
In fact , a small changes such as this one has slowly helped , evolve into a much more corporate business and personable partner .
Although the trend toward creating more conversational content is on the rise , not everyone has gotten on board yet .
There are still plenty of companies holding on to their formal corporate speak .
Not only that . Many of the companies that have adopted a more conversational tone .
As a result , you may find companies that are warm and engaging in one another .
That kind of can muddle a brand and confuse what .
Some help on how to relax in my eyes , it is important to establish a conversational tone across all of your company 's content .
One of the knee-jerk knee-jerk that companies have to is that companies wo n't take them seriously if they do .
My response to that is simple .
You have always got to create your content with a clear understanding of the situation .
In other words , you should always be honesty , but always strive to be honest , depending on the situation .
For example , you do not see it laughing jokes or trying to come across as too cute or trying to come across their new error .
That is because they understand that the message is about the fact that their software crashed .
They have managed to tailor their tone , so it is both conversational and appropriate to the particular situation .
I do not recommend trying to be too extravagant with your messaging either .
You want your language to come across as natural , and not so it does n't seem sincere .
My final piece of advice is to make sure that your content is consistent .
You have a lot of different writers in your understand .
If your marketing content is going to adopt a more personal tone , then you need to figure out how that tone will translate to all of your company 's other content .
The Bottom Line : `` You Customers '' is all about building relationships with your customers .
One of the keys to doing that is talking to them like the people they are .
Give your content and adopt a more conversational tone with your content .
In other words , begin writing more like the way people actually talk .
Trust me , you will thank you for it .
At Acrolinx we know how important it is for companies to create content for their customers .
That is because when your content is consistent , tone of voice , tone of terminology , and other may preferences .
In turn in , can lead to greater customer and ultimately an increase in both sales and advocacy .
I believe that any time we sit down with individual content in their company 's content .
In fact , when we recently surveyed individual content to ask them how they thought most of their company 's content is , 63 .
Be that as it may , our view is that those numbers do not reflect the reality of the situation .
The fact is that most content teams tend to only think about the content they are responsible for creating , and never take into account .
As soon as we bring multiple content teams from the same company together , that reality usually becomes obvious .
The problem is that most likely do not have a way of managing and optimizing .
Why does that matter ?
Let us remember the point with an example .
Take a look at the understand above that are featured in the image of this blog post .
You no doubt them and have probably noticed that there is something strange about them .
The fact is that there is a bit at least a bit but you immediately notice that something is wrong .
We love making this point with showing them with showing versions of their own logos .
People react to seeing their logo in their company because it represents their company .
When it 's not used properly because — 's not only do people notice , it also degrades the brand .
It is the same thing with your company 's content .
Every time you are able to read a piece of support content that tells them how to use your product or service , it 's exactly like your logo .
It is a experience that can damage and weaken .
It can make you look inexpensive .
That , in our opinion , is a visual way of thinking about what your language is doing , on our message and aligned with the personality that you are trying to project .
Just as you would never compromise the quality and consistency on how you represent your brand through your content .
If you are a content marketer and you are trying to scale your content marketing marketing , one of the biggest decisions you need .
You have two main options . Both of those have pros and cons .
You can either create your content in house or outsource in a task .
You do n't have to choose one option to the exclusion of both .
Let us take a look at the ups and downs of each option to find out .
You can understand the case if it 's easy to make the case that everyone works out for marketing .
Why spend your precious budget dollars when you can turn your precious budget when you can turn to help with your content creation .
The reality is that since everyone in your company is in some way responsible for trying to engage in your program , and engage in them and engage them as content in the way them engage in the ability to fuel your program .
Not only that , as they are as close to your business as can be and are therefore therefore therefore better than anyone else 's tone to create content .
It is a great plan , at least in theory .
In practice , however , relying is on your colleagues for content more challenging .
The reality is that most people are not good writers , that is getting them to create content for you that you can actually publish .
A hurdle is a hurdle with the proper training , however , this is a hurdle .
In addition , it is a significant difference , and it could result in your content marketing marketing .
I am not sure even if you have the good writers throughout your endeavors .
I understand all of your content , it can , over time , result in it becoming quite quite quite quite quite a bit .
That is hardly a formula for content that stands out , and drives it can .
Outsourcing , Content is to a Third-Party that brings us to the alternative , which brings us to the content party or an agency .
Just be a great way to keep your content and ensure someone else to create your content , can be a great way to keep your content fresh .
If you think that outsourcing your content means that outsourcing your content means that you can absolve yourself of all the responsibility and still get a great outcome .
In the contrary , these kinds of can only work well when you are in a successful outcome .
There is a learning curve to overcome here as well .
You are already will be new to your company and perhaps your industry .
They will need time to get up to speed before they are able to start creating content that really resonates with your audience .
Plus , if someone else is creating all of your content , you 're carefully at brand risk unless you are carefully carefully .
The reality is that no third-party can represent your company . It 's brand better than you .
It 's hard to understand the situation , but a bit it 's just the best idea .
If you are looking to scale your content marketing program , you will likely find that you get the best results when you do a combination of in-house .
The key is to strike the right balance and that will take some extent .
In the meantime , you can be sure , both of you have at your understand , both of them , both that can happen when you need them .
Recently , I participated in a way about how to do content marketing at scale .
It is a part of that conversation and I talked about a variety of interesting topics , including one that seems to be at the heart of a major dilemma .
I am talking about the age-old debate over whether quantity , or quality quality or quality matters when it comes to achieving content .
One of the things drivers behind the debate may be the fact that it is something that a weak mentality when it comes to adopting content marketing .
I am under the impression that marketers is under the price to scale their content marketing .
That is a unique situation .
Do you start it up in a business where they are proven proven in a relationship ?
I suggest Apple as an example .
Do you think Tim Cook decided to begin mass-producing as soon as he saw the first prototype ?
Of course not .
He waited until they had the product , just right .
When it comes to content for some reason , we rarely apply the same logic .
Instead , as content in the fact that we often hold ourselves to grueling schedules , so we can produce enough content to keep up with demand .
I believe this reality are the results of study by the Content Marketing Institute and MarketingProfs .
To be certain there has always been a strong trend within the industry being content , even if that meant sacrificing sacrificing quality .
There was a time when it worked just fine .
A few years ago , for example : if you were the first company in your industry industry you would find an instant competitive advantage .
Because none of you are trying to build relationships with customers , it was pretty easy to win over yours with whatever content you created .
It 's a crowded content marketing marketing , but no longer works .
There is so much competition that allows you to obtain great content , or you will get very great content .
Put another way . It is not about creating more content , it is about creating better content .
That is why I think we need to wipe out content .
While mediocre content may have sufficed at one point , today is no longer good enough .
Not only that since there is no such thing since there is no such thing since there is no such thing since there is no such thing since your brand can actually erode your brand .
That is because every one piece of content you publish is going to leave an impression on your target audience .
If that impression is not positive , it is by default going to be negative .
That in turn means lower engagement and people tuning you out .
The majority of this is not important to us .
It does .
It 's only that you can not afford to sacrifice quality for quantity .
You are takeaway from all of this is simple : focus on creating the best pieces of content that you can .
It is only when you have mastered creating quality quality quality that you will be ready to scale more .
While any content would ever admit to not having a strategy , the truth is that many do not .
At least not the kind of thoughtful strategy , you need to get real results .
In fact , less than half of it B2B , B2B and those who do n't put the rigor into their strategies .
In other words , using the fully baked content are the exception and not the exception .
So what is everyone else doing ?
A lot of marketers , marketers , are no exception like to experiment with different individual tactics .
They might try out blogging for a while , and then switch their focus to creating videos .
They may test out one type of paid promotion .
Some of those individual tactics can , and do work — — and do work — into cohesive .
They often do not get the right amounts of the things that they want and instead have the effort to rely on the needle to move needle .
It may have the deep resources for most likely to create lots of content .
The businesses need to get results .
I am having a good content , but having a good content is not going to be a luxury , but rather an imperative future .
Because more companies adopt content and begin competing for you , and allows you to cut through all the noise and stand out .
If you do n't already have a well thought out , why can you do to create one ?
Start by asking yourself these four questions . How well do you know your are ?
It will shepherd down the path to create content , you have to understand who those things are .
Start out with gathering information about them as much information by either interviewing people or by talking to the opinions individuals you understand .
Try to find out what their role in the buying process is a short persona and pain for a purchase .
Here is an example of what a buyer persona might look like Adam is a Sardar , of sales , CRM .
He finds his existing existing tool tool , but he does not know there are better solutions but unreliable .
In my opinion , Adam is the final thing and while price is an important motivating when making a purchase , he's .
As part of your research , you also need to study your research 's journey , i.e. . The steps that he or she will take leading up to making a purchase .
In doing so , turn out where along that journey your buyer is mostly likely to get hung up or stuck and why .
For example , a simplified buyer 's journey might look like this , where the sticking points are to ease whatever your content necessary is to ease .
What actions do you want to take ?
Once you have a good understanding of your buyers , it is time to think about what actions you want them to take as a result of what actions you want them to take as a result .
If you include a specific page on your website , you can include a specific page on your website Opening a piece of content smaller and ultimate e-mail .
Make sure that you are setting a conversion goal for each piece of content that you create .
For example , trying to get prospects who are just visiting your site for the first time to buy the first time .
There is a more appropriate page to get them to visit a specific page .
What content are you going to create ?
The content of your strategy is to consider the content itself .
You will want to decide what content content you 're trying to achieve .
To help you make the decision and make the decision you are creating content that will resonate with your preferences .
Likewise , you will want to ensure that the type of content you select is the stage of the buyer journey .
It does not matter how good you are , it is possible for example : they are not the right form of content with drawing new people with drawing new ideas with limited opinions .
How will you deliver your content ?
It is the last thing that you need to consider is how you need to consider how you would get your content to go into a later post .
Your head at this stage is to figure out which methods are most effective and the stage journey they are in .
In the process , you will want to keep a few basic guidelines in mind , Cheaper or social ones .
Unless you need your budget , why need your budget on content ?
You will need to use multiple forms of contact to get your content out .
It is not enough to post content to your website , you need to share it socially , and find every chances you can maximize your chances .
The easier the form of contact is to execute to understand your content .
Make sure that form of contact is good enough to drive the specific , conversion .
Remember , how you deliver your content is just as , if not more , important than the content itself , so you will want to ensure that you get this step .
Once you have a hard time understanding the information , you can organize the information that you gather about each other or understand how they work together .
If they are all carefully carefully thought through and aligned with each other , you will be well on your way to developing a successful content .
A content strategy may be optional today , but in the near future it will be the one thing that makes or breaks your content program .
I believe Marketing 2014 , Benchmarks 2014 , Benchmarks .
I have seen too many , but who make the mistake of acting like venture capitalists with their content strategy .
In other words , they bank their ability to hit a few winners without worrying too much about everything else .
Well , this `` let a thousand flowers bloom '' . It is deadly for VCs .
Because there is no such thing as neutral .
It is positive , but it is not Neutral , but it is n't Neutral .
There is no such thing as neutral .
I suggest that you publish the content of your content that you publish that is not great is working against you by degrading audiences and your long-term relationship .
That means content where you do not have a good story to your target audience , or where your tone of voice is actually working against you .
In many cases , you would be able to be better off not publishing .
It may sound extreme , and it is , but in today is true .
Think of your own experience and willingness to engage with brands and understand .
The content of content helps you stand out , but great content helps you out , and create better experiences for you , opt out and ultimately , and ultimately , ultimately , opt to abandon the relationship .
For businesses that have long believed they could rely on quantity , rather than quality as the quality of the quality , to be effective .
To be clear , however , I am not suggesting that quantity is not an important factor in successful content marketing .
You can not create a single piece of flawless once a year and do not get great results .
You need to produce content on a consistent basis .
That said , your challenge is figuring out how to make sure that it is always of the highest quality .
There are a lot of great tools and platforms out there that can help you .
As an interesting side note , it is worth pointing out this year we launched pointing on global quality quality quality .
A key finding this report was that only 33 percent of the companies focused on the content focused on the top brands .
It is clear to be accomplished on the quality front .
So as you think about your own content , remember that neutral neutral does not exist .
Your perception can be found for every piece of content you publish .
The are high , but the potential benefits of getting it right .
I recently had the opportunity to participate in an activity with the Content Marketing in which I outlined .
In my opinion , the first two of the challenges are whether or not everyone should work for marketing and if the customer journey actually has a finish journey — .
Currently , I would like to explain the other three challenges for you .
If you would like to watch the actual spelling , you can access it online .
The problem is to toward casual content in order to connect with your target audience . You must talk to them in a more casual experience .
You have to do so with a tone and tone of voice .
While this is n't news complex to many brands , plenty of others still hold on to the idea that it is n't credible , and it wo n't be credible .
The reality is that those may not be further from the truth .
You need to research what you need to be talked to .
That means that it is not only adopting a more personal and engaging in a tone , but also a unique personality helps to differentiate between you .
It 's also worth pointing out that you are messages so that they understand their messages .
On the contrary , when it is done well , it will demonstrate that you really know what you are talking about .
Consistency is in a world where everyone creates content content to create content .
The fact is that getting professionals who may not normally be content creators is a challenge in and of itself .
Getting them do so in a way that is on brand brand , on brand , on brand , on brand , and consistent voice is even harder .
One solution is that many companies turn to create a style guide .
The problem with that approach is that in many cases , it is never actually consulted .
I have also spoken to many companies that have multiple style , typically virtually one department tend to understand .
Never fully recognize this as an issue .
They often look at their own marketing content when checking for anything .
Unfortunately , such as the technical content , such as take all of the other content their companies produce all of the other content , such as online .
The problem is that all of that content is consistent in terms of voice , tone of voice , and style , you are putting yourself at degrading your brand .
The future of content marketing arise as the most way that most marketing marketing arise , and measure themselves measure of themselves .
Even though it is particularly content in most industries , they can be content of content at the core of them .
The key to successful content is creating great content marketing is creating great content , and creates a desired impact .
Doug Kessler , who I mentioned in my previous post has come up with a great formula that reflects this .
It is Story , the voice of the impact is that you need a great story .
Even with a great story , that content wo n't work if it does n't have the right voice so that it speaks to your audience .
If you do get the voice right , it is like force multiplier , it is like force multiplier .
The content marketing industry is growing up quickly , but it continues to face a number of challenges .
In my opinion , all five of the issues I have cited changers going to be game .
What do you think ?
Are there other trends or challenges that we should discuss ?
I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below .
I recently had the opportunity to participate in an activity with the Content Marketing in which I outlined .
I would like to share those challenges in case you missed the mind .
While I will be the first to admit that some of the points that follow are more controversial , I believe they are all becoming becoming mainstream .
I will save the first two challenges in this post and save the other three for a second post .
If you would like to watch the things , you can access it online here .
Should everyone work for marketing ?
It is one of the central tenants that you need to be in a relationship with and prospects by regularly providing them with the content they require .
I believe that content should not just come from marketing issues , but also from individuals and related parties .
I believe who understand this has historically had a strong desire to obtain more content in their opinions .
When the Content Content marketers when the Content Content marketers what their top priority was back in 2014 .
It 's unfortunate that the quality of marketers has been an overwhelming overwhelming types of content , regardless of all types of content .
The reality , however , is that just having more content marketing marketing .
On the contrary , giving people too much content can be problematic .
Doug Kessler , the Co-founder , and Creative Rouge at Velocity , Partners .
In his presentation , it makes a plea to content and soliciting on developing smaller quality content on developing smaller smaller content .
The content marketing industry has grown up a little bit .
The activities are looking more carefully to determine what types of content they choose .
Actually , in fact , in the 2015 of the same version of the same , in the manner of Marketing Institute , survey , respondents .
So while content marketers may still want everyone to be a part of the marketing team , they 're realizing that they need to be more selective .
Does the customer journey have a finish line ?
It can be hard to spend a lot of time talking about customer , but spend a lot of time talking about customer .
In any case , they often think about customer customer in the terms of a sales of a sales of a sales , starting with awareness and understand .
While it is true that you do need to provide it , it 's true that you need to provide content and content with content at every stage of the customer journey . It is the typical journey looks like the typical journey .
It would be a messy line that would be a messy line that goes in different directions .
As long as you would like to think of a buyer 's journey as a beautiful diagram with an beautiful diagram , trying to plan for that is a loser 's game .
Instead , you need to think of the buyer 's journey as being more chaotic and filled with different inflection .
Your job is as a content , it is to make sure that you are customers and prospects and bump into your content at a specific direction .
One of the implications of this is that if you invest a lot of time and money creating great content before a sale used , you do not have the same content used for the content used for the content .
Taking under consideration that is as an example .
Prior to making a purchase of a purchase for a beautiful content that is glossy .
As soon as they have made a purchase , they are suddenly suddenly suddenly to receiving content that is dull and clunky .
That is a problem . As many people have shown , people look at the understand before they purchase a product .
That means that technical art is similar to users users ' manuals .
I understand that the changes of your game has a connected journey in terms of having a connected journey and unified .
The reality is that there is no end to the customer journey , and it is also clear that you need to provide them with a continuous provide to provide them properly .
In my next post , I will dive into the three other content , I mega-trend of the three other content , and the future of content marketing marketing is content .
If you enjoyed this post , I hope you will see it .
As you might imagine , most good writers are certain when it comes to using proper grammar and punctuation .
They cringe when they see it used to pluralize nouns with the contraction or any number of other mistakes that can creep their way into writing .
While it is always a good idea to eliminate errors from your writing , it is very important to break certain rules , especially if it helps you to break the right tone .
That is all good and good , provided you know which rules you can break and which ones you can not .
The good news is that the list of rules you can break is shorter than the ones that you can not .
As a general rule of thumb , you should always write the way you were taught , and then go back and look for opportunities to make your writing more conversational .
To help you get started , below are five of the most common rules that we encourage you to consider why .
Never end a sentence with a preposition in school , we are taught with a preposition in a sin .
The reality is that strictly result in language that strictly result in language .
Consider the difference between these two sentences . What software is the new product with ?
With which software is the new product compatible ?
As frequently as we understand , we understand both sentences .
However , does the first sentence sound more natural than the second ?
Of course it does , and that is why you should write it that way even if it means that you have a preposition at the end of your sentence .
Do n't split up an issue with prepositions , we also learn that we are never supposed to split up the infinitive .
In writing .
That is often true , but there are times when splitting the infinitive just works better .
Think of Star Trek 's famous motto for example : `` To boldly where no man has gone before . ''
In that example , the infinitive `` to go '' is split by the adverb .
If we were to follow the rules , and avoid the splitting , the sentence would change to change where no man has gone before .
Now does n't have the same effect .
Your subjects always have to agree with your thoughts , however this is definitely true 95 percent of the time .
For example , compare the two lines below .
Apple is a great company .
It has amazing products that can be of love .
Apple is a great company .
They have amazing products that can be found in love .
The first set of sentences is technically technically the correct one , the second set of Apple . The second set of Apple .
Plus , usage like this is so widespread that most people will not fault you for using this more conversational style .
Do n't start your sentences with the right `` conjunctions '' , but , if you say , yes , or if , true enough .
Do so selectively ( like we just did at the start of this sentence ) .
The problem is to use them in understand , when you are doing so can help you be more direct or establish a more direct tone .
I believe need multiple sentences , sentences need multiple sentences , but these are often rules , but there are times when they can be broken .
Very well !
You are doing so can give the cadence of your writing a much needed needed needed .
Just look back at this blog post to see some examples and paragraph lengths in our attempt to keep you interested .
How did we go ?
We have only only scratched here in terms of the rules that you can bend or break .
What is the other group to mind that you enjoy it ?
At Acrolinx we have a vision to help the world 's greatest brands at scale .
It is no small feat , in fact , it is a problem to overcome .
Before I tell you how we are doing it , let me take a minute to explain what led us down this path .
Over the past few years , there has been a tidal that everyone has been a part of — .
We all discover , learn and buy things differently today than we did .
It is because we live in a difficult manner , it is quite difficult .
As exciting as that is , our minds are certain of the challenges of creating high-quality content at scale .
I believe that we are uniquely to us , they turned to us for a solution .
That is why we started it re-imagining what kind of software it would take to support large complex companies of content , teams .
We knew that the solution would have to support diverse and users users .
It would have to be incredibly easy to set up and use , but customizable customers , customizable , and be flexible to support a wide range of use and content types .
It would need even more powerful language than our previous software .
That is how Acrolinx was born .
Our existing problem is analytics , our new , cloud-based , our new , cloud-based and tone .
Depending on how people can make it better .
It is difficult to make it easy for companies to create great content that is on-brand , but drives results .
We are incredibly excited about this offering , and some of the features our customers will love .
Here are a few : Audience , Personalization , can define unique audience with words , phrases , unique audience and keywords .

However , I am certain it is possible for a moment to exist , left .
I am in it , but it can a new research project project to read and evaluate the world 's content .
Our software 's linguistic is analytics of 340 . We evaluated the major companies from around the world .
It can be Gucci , Audi , Audi and many more .
This is a part of the analysis of the analysis of our software , our software `` more than 20 million sentences spread across 150,000 . ''
That represents over 160 million words .
At this point , you might be wondering why we did this .
The simple reason is that we wanted to cast a light on what we believe is an important reason , readable .
With that in mind , we launched our research , looking at content in terms of quality and an indication of how easy you clarity and of how easy you read .
Depending on the situation , we were able to give each company an content content score .
It is the benchmark we were looking to see whether or not companies of 72 or above , which is the benchmark .
The group is no one single and the overall scores is hard to believe between forty and 85 points .
While only 31 of the companies we studied had scores or higher , most fell below it threshold .
We believe that the companies are high-marks that the companies may be far better for content quality will be far better , positioned in a world , customer , and loyalty .

Why do you not understand the important role in the case that you have not seen the important role that you have in case you have not play in creating better customer 's content ?
It also asked that the key to great content is focusing on your story , tone of voice , and consistency .
Interesting take away . Did you know that 86 percent of buyers , are willing to pay more for a better customer experience ?
I believe they content marketers and measure much of what they do .
For instance , they want to know , how many page views views they have generated , what the open and most important things are , how many prospects they have converted into it .
That is all well , but if you reread that last sentence you will see it a bit ; it reveals a way it reveals a way .
Here is a hint at what we have used to construct the sentence .
The reality is that today is often offer only a mirror in the past .
It analyzing in looking back at past performance data across across a number of metrics , but content should do regularly .
Getting into the discipline of doing so is helpful , not only to facilitate your strategy .
By the way , you can identify trends , you can identify trends and pinpoint what you have done .
Even with the most difficult — , even with the kind performed performed on a weekly , if not daily , therefore informed them about what to do next .
The content of content with the future marketers , who is rigorous about analytics than those who pay into the past .
Are you ready for an entire future ?
The new marketing is an open that will pave the Holy Grail of content .
I believe future topics can be found around a variety of data , such as future , analytics , and will be able to help you with their users and cull .
I believe with their audience to cover these topics when I can ensure that content reaches the right content .
This may sound like science fiction to anyone more concerned than the power of words .
If you want to be ready , there are a few things you should start doing now , Determine what is metrics ?
There are new tools emerging in different aspects of your content marketing .
I wonder if it 's easy to meeting your goals , because it 's easy to meeting your goals , and any supporting you .
It is a distraction .
I believe tracking those specifically are rare .
If you are not already tracking the things that matter to you , it is time to start .
If you are , depending on how long ago you started , you may need to go back and gather historical .
You can use a deep well well performance that you can use as a future well data .
I believe what tools already offer can be found certain .
For our target giving our content , it will be with your target giving me successful for example it will be with your target audience .
There is truth in the old adage that `` old adage '' is power .
The next generation of content , it is that knowledge that knowledge will damage them how to craft and deliver better content .
The result will be more effective content that is able to anticipate people 's needs rather than just react to them .
In case you had not noticed , in today 's online world we are practically drowning in content , than we could ever begin to consume .
To give you a sense of it , just consider that every day of it , every day blog posts are published and 294 .
The problem is that a lot of that content is going to waste .
It is not very good and most people are tuning most of it .
If you are a business trying to build strong relationships with your strong relationships , that presents a challenge .
How do you go about creating content that stands out , so that your target audience enjoys it and converts as a result ?
Great content begins with information that your audience will find but interesting , and even even entertaining .
That is just the point point .
Your language matters as well .
The trick to making great content is making sure it has the following five characteristics .
It has to be very difficult .
When you create content , nothing is more important than making it easy to understand , which mainly depends on whether the content is readable .
The activities of a piece of content is shaped by many factors , including including including factors , terminology , spelling , and grammar .
I believe .
In order to build relationships with your audience , you can build the emotional connection with your audience necessary to Foster engagement .
It is so hard for you to say and makes your content less engaging , but other factors play a part of your personal beliefs . How can it be and lively ?
I believe .
Because content comes from many sources and outside of your mind , you can understand .
I can confuse readers .
I believe can also affect your company 's brand brand .
I inconsistently above the noise of a crowded marketplace , but if your company name is difficult , product or key messages .
I believe .
If you put content on a dedicated portal , you can support content on a dedicated portal or making marketing content .
There are SEO `` tricks '' , but there are SEO `` tricks on creating your search '' rankings on creating keywords .
I believe .
Many capital markets , such as India , China , have driven in global trade over the last decade .
This is what is possible for nations in nations of nations , they create opportunities in nations with mature things .
It is to satisfy yourself in these new markets , companies must localize their content into more languages .
That means doing everything you can to ensure that you are writing is clear and efficient .
The bottom line is that it is not enough just to create content anymore .
Your content has to be great , or you are losing an opportunity to help your business .
I 'm making sure that your content is readable , engaging in consistent effort .
The information is otherwise , otherwise , otherwise , is a content management and social media , choreographer , and archive their information .
The heart of every good content marketing is rarely enough .
To be successful , you need to have the right , but processes in place .
For example , content marketers marketers often devise for deciding and which topics .
They also have it for under the content of reviewing reviewing the content of the right people approve .
They have a variety of things through the network through their network .
In my opinion , many of today 's content can be those at least be best and as a result can present a certain situation .
Think of all the things calendars calendars in calendars in static .
It 's the editorial standards that are painstakingly that are in hard copy that no one reads .
Do you know how many people have you seen in a document , or PowerPoint , that get filed away and are quickly apart ?
The fact is that the fact supporting many of today 's content are often manual .
I suggest you consider the example of many companies in order to use a condom to deliver their content .
Their programs can only receive the specific messages like a king and it is not terribly effective .
What all this means is that today 's content is often slow and inefficient .
As a result , for people charged with scaling programs , often the only solution to the brute .
All of that may be enough to get by today , the successful content marketers of tomorrow .
A more difficult future , and how to get ready for it Going and not just harder and not harder to get results .
I believe they will understand who their target audience is and what they care about .
I understand what their audiences are referring to online so they can insert themselves into their conversations with themselves .
I believe time to cut down , but editorial calendaring and to cut down considerably .
I believe that greater producers across companies across companies that are better together .
I believe keywords can be found in the internet and it can happen engines .
It can recall their language by embedding into style , terminology , and tone of voice directly .
Create the content of content to content for different audiences .
It resulted in how any content in the matter was consumed , if any , actions , actions , actions , and any other nature .
I 'm not sure with predictive with predictive .
There are many tools necessary to do already already exist and will continue to become more sophisticated in the months and years .
Those who do not will begin to appear in the marketplace in the future .
If you 're still getting by with an old school approach to an old school approach to content , but it may be time to identify where the weaknesses and weaknesses are .
It is likely that you are not going to have an unlimited budget for new tools , so you will want to be very clear on where you see the most opportunity .
I believe the tools are available on the tools that they offer .
When doing so , there are a number of factors that you should take into consideration , including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including including , including including including systems .
The difference between the content between content and failure will be determined and failure to be determined .
If yours is built on ad ad , solutions hoc , or any other occurrence , you are going to have a very difficult time .
If you are a content , marketer marketer you on a regular basis to pitch their products and services .
I management content , curation , and hosting services .
You need to be successful .
Probably not , but you may need some of it .
The challenge is to becomes precious which will work out which is out of those services to allocate .
This is in mind that we wanted to give you a simple way to figure out if your company needs content .
Please do so , just read the five statements below .
If any of them apply to you and you might want to consider taking a closer look at some of the content optimization to help you , which can help you improve your content .
There are lots of different people producing content within your understand , but no one can standardizes it all .
Many things . It 's particularly larger ones . Have numerous writers who sit across multiple writers , technical documentation , and customer service .
When it comes to content marketing , outside agencies are often involved .
Yet , there are rarely a process in place to align with the content of the writers ' writers .
As a result , the content is often inconsistent , which can confuse — and worse .
If this is a problem at your company , the right content can probably help .
Your content is n't the well search results .
If people are not finding your content when they search on Google , you probably have not optimized .
Type engine in the way that you are content with keywords such as content in content and headings .
Since not every writer thinks about the content they create from an internet tool , they create a tool that prompts them to include keywords in the correct places .
You have it overseas and need to make translation as cost-effective .
Thank you for the Internet . We live in a global economy , where small companies regularly exist .
In multiple languages , the advertisements of multiple languages need to be able to deliver their content .
I understand , good content optimization , software can help by the process by standardizing .
It has already been translated by allowing more translation to allowing more by allowing more by allowing more efficient by allowing more by allowing more by allowing terms and phrases in the future .
Just wants to see how well you are managing and improving quality quality .
Good content optimization will not only measure your process , so it will measure your process so that you can see how it is improving .
I believe it is capabilities in which you can assess your results , you can assess your results , your results , and identify your problem areas .
You want to give it the best experience possible .
Today 's online world is increasingly driven by content .
As a result , your content is ( in terms of terms ) , accuracy terms of voice , and tone of voice , among other factors ... the better you can be .

I need to find out more and to learn how to help your company develop .
What are you Company of voice of voice , Matters , and How to get it right ?
It is possible that often pay lip service to the need to create great content .
I believe , many of them do not just talk the talk , they try to walk the talk , but personas .
Usually , taking the form of short descriptions , these are intended to help marketers , as are personify and what they care about .
Unfortunately , in many cases , in many cases , these people are not lack depth .
The problem is that most content is , do not treat persona , as a rigorous .
They often develop a relationship with their brain based on their gut based on who they think about who they are .
Check a lot of knowledge and experience , and are certainly an important starting point .
I believe the time marketers is that even if marketers marketers to use them .
That is because after going to the trouble of creating , you can use them as a reference tool over time .
It is not possible to get far less less of a bearing on the company 's content .
All of these problems lead to a single result , the generic content is not particularly effective .
Do n't Get Left Behind forward , this somewhat lackadaisical to understanding .
I validated , savvy content are already the bar by taking the time to truly understand their content ; validated , and then fully fully integrate .
In fact , it wo n't be long until it wo n't be long until content marketing . It is all that aspects of ensuring the problem , well-crafted .
It is possible to find the result of carefully to resonate with specific audiences , and to resonate delivered to delivered it .
What can you do to get ready ?
If you have to become the insightful they need to become the insightful they should become .
It is important that it can be important in your online audience ; therefore , it can be important to resonate and prospects in your target audience .
If you use your audience plays golf , you can influence references to references to the references and references to your content .
You have separate customer , perhaps for each of your unique audiences , perhaps trying to create a single persona to use the board .
Most companies have different types of garbage , they represent a different pain points , and they represent a different use of case .
It 's possible that they can target each type of customer specifically .
You should begin small by focusing small by focusing on just the two or three , or three things that matter most of your business rather than trying to physically subdue them .
Just continue to be the content `` matrix '' that can not be downloaded and future content , but also to specific stages within the customer journey .
It is possible to help you to create your content between your content and your target strategy .
Write out a content pertaining to how to create a content soundtrack .
Whoa your distribution , to be relevant , and the stages of the customer journey they are in .
As an example , you are not going to rely on people finding your late-stage directly and hopefully receiving your content directly .
It 's natural to raise awareness because it 's natural to raise awareness .
The reality is that in content marketing , you have to take the time to find out the right information about your target audience .
You may have been able to get by with it , but in the past , going forward forward in the past , going forward to the quality of your customer strategy and your ability to align .
How can your customer address relate to your customer , what steps to create them ?
Share your experiences in the comments section below .
I believe it is the fourth post in a series about tone of voice .
You can read our previous posts about what tone of voice is and how to develop your tone of voice and how to develop your tone .
Once you have defined your company 's tone , the challenge becomes figuring out how to bring it to life in your content .
How do you give your content a formal tone such as an X-Box or an inspirational tone versus an practical tone ?
In this post , we will take a look at the different elements of writing that you need to consider when you need your tone of voice .
By adjusting , you will be able to create whatever type of tone you are after .
It is a bad length of children to learn shorter words .
If you want to be clearly understood by readers of all reading levels , use shorter words .
In terms of tone , short words are simple and direct , while longer ones suggest it .
Short words tend to be harder and harder , while longer words can give a softer , more relaxed effect .
I believe that it is length because it is primarily quicker because I am longer sedate sentences .
A good guide is that you should be able to read any sentence in the single breath .
The key word is average , but Using Using shorter average sentence is average .
To keep readers interested , vary the length of sentences and paragraphs .
Do Pronouns around place of the names of people or things ?
Your choice can have a big effect on your tone .
For example , when writing about your company , you can use the first person .
The first person is more immediate , positioning yourself as a group of people , while the third person is much more detached .
I 'm not sure Conciseness is the ratio of ideas to words .
The fewer words you use to convey is the idea .
On a practical level , more is better .
Getting to the point saves to the point saves .
If you want to adopt a more flowing , rambling or tone , you will need some extra words to achieve the words laid-back .
I am not sure Jargon is specialized in particular professional , finance , and among others .
There is good , bad , and bad , just like there is good and bad .
It is there to hide the truth and the people .
It is a good idea on the other hand , signals signals that you are part of a community and Bible .
I believe it is jargon Buzzwords Buzzwords that have the attraction of novelty .
It is a lot of buzzwords , particularly in the technology industry , even though they need to name innovations .
The same caution applies to buzzwords , only use them if you know the audience will understand .
Also , remember that today is attractive , why is tomorrow 's embarrassing ?
I believe Clichés is words and phrases that have become worn in it .
I B2B such as `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` proactive , '' such as , `` proactive '' , `` proactive , '' such as , `` proactive , '' and `` leverage , '' but `` leverage , '' but I have now become certain .
USING CASE will probably make your tone sound stale and dull .
There may be times when you need to meet readers when you need to meet a Morrocan you know they will respond to , but you could pay up sounding like everyone else .
Do n't , '' Contractions are formed of two words combined into one , such as `` `` `` So , '' or `` Do you 're , '' is that ?
Most people use it all the time when they talk , except in the most formal situations .
With them in writing makes your tone , informal and gives readers a strong sense of being in a conversation .
I believe Colloquial is the language of everyday speech — .
It is a flexible term because the definition of casual varies to speaker , and from culture to culture .
It may be likely to use contractions , and may also include slang , or profanity .
It 's unusual for a unusual effect to understand or unusual words using a similar effect .
You might want to drop one in from time to time to time to suggest refinement or a certain type of heritage .
Try to make it clear from just what the word word means .
For example , UK cake brand brand the slogan slogan uses the slogan `` Exceedingly '' .
Since it 's obvious , exceedingly , mean `` anyone can understand the slogan . ''
Cleanliness is a result of problems that can creep into your writing and include words , such as peek and grammar .
Most people would agree that using the wrong word , or spelling the right word , is undesirable .
It is creative unless it is part of a deliberate .
You can your company 's tone of voice to life like these in your content to achieve the desired effect .
The challenge for a large number is figuring out how to do so at scale .
I need to find out more and to learn how to help your company develop .

It is hard to distributing , Globalize '' Globalize '' , Accelerate , and distributing .
At the end of the session , we touched on a topic that has been a challenge for globalization , what languages to your content .
I gave it a triangle .
One point of that triangle is retrospective .
I believe teams statistics have used rear-view data such as past years , revenue .
When I started at it in its late nineties , these these were the primary data points .
Actually , that was one of the most common scenarios : `` We need to get this deal , make it so ! ''
When the web revolution happened in the early 2000s , the second point of the triangle came in to play : real-time .
There were web sites that are now able to measure the content and visitors around the web , and spotting .
I can tell you which items tell you which items are being accessed technology technology .
With the advent of content optimization tools such as tools and marketing managers for target and audiences .
The third point of the triangle includes this past decade .
Things can be seen on the web , they are talking amongst amongst other on the web networks , reputation , talking , etc .
With tools such as , Journey Analytics and message and message by scooping on factors .

It is still great to have retrospective points as well as well as well .
Adding big data on top of this provides a measure of confidence .
Whether you manage your website to take your website global for the first time or add the right markets , or invest decisions of the triangle points .

As part of our ongoing ongoing , Strategy is Strategy in the globe . We have been thinking executive around the globe .
At each one , we bring industry together to talk about a variety of content issues .
At the recent forum , in San Francisco , for example , Scott Francisco , Scott may have been through a large group of marketing group . I SDL of your content , SDL .
The discussion Marketing off the discussion with Steve Bear 's results in comparing the results of comparing the results .
When asked what their greatest challenge was in 2014 , 64 percent of content marketers .
A year later later , that response was not even among among three challenges .
Even though their greatest , their greatest , obstacle was creating engaging content , followed by 54 percent and 50 percent of understand , respectively .
The numbers in the process of a year show is that over the course of year , content marketers . It 's quality and overall in the process .
For Andrew , this shift in priorities is a sign that the industry is maturing .
I believe in the past content in the past content metrics , typically goals are tied to content .
They are increasingly concerned about a confusing appearance like focusing on the volume of content .
Performing content in the way they make in the scale is engaging in content at scale .
To do so , you have to know how to create content that people are actually interested in , which is no small feat itself .
I believe that means taking the time to develop meaningful issues , but you can understand your target audience .
It also means that it is the traditional sales and marketing mindset of knowing that all the piece of content is always a sales .
Instead , succeed to succeed at content marketing , you have to create content that answers or provides them with information .
These days pointed out how important it is for to adapt to the information .
All the different kinds of content that were previously available online .
You can find product information , FAQs , or anything you need to facilitate without ever talking to a salesperson .
In addition , Google even tends to favor technical content like this over traditional marketing content .
I Unify in your organization and scale to many content creators in many content creators .
It is the only way you can unify your content marketing .
That as well , however , it is easier said than done .
Their content is different in large capacity , different departments can fail to work together .
Instead , they each do their own thing , which can easily lead to inconsistencies and situations with another 's .
The key is to be key from this segment from this segment to succeed marketing .
That means that they have to work together to ensure that they are creating engaging in engaging in engaging that way , regardless of their employment .
When creating a content of content comes first , creating a lot of content creating lots of content , can help them down the path to purchase .
I would like to ask you to take a minute to indulge a simple request , pretend that you are a simple engaging with the first time .
Are you with me ?
If so , imagine that your initial point of contact with that brand brand when you happen to happen upon online news item while you happen to see online .
While you are intrigued by the news to the company that you decide to learn more .
Before you know it , you are happily reading about the company 's products .
Some of that product content reads well , and really speaks to you .
However , as you read more , you discover other bits that other bits do not do .
Maybe not immediately , but after awhile the company starts to feel disjointed to you .
Do not only do some pages contain errors while others do not , it is as if the company has several several personalities .
In fact , you get the impression that the company you are dealing with are n't coordinated or working together .
While it is a deal-breaker , it is an early warning sign that the company you are dealing with may not be very polished or professional .
Reading some of the company 's Q & As and other support content , it is not nearly as good as some support you just read .
If you really want other choices , you will find yourself questioning if you want to have other choices .
If you are not getting a consistent experience on their website , you can make a purchase from them .
There is enough to let you talk about the facts .
The fact is that for an entirely number of can customers , content inconsistency , or signals it could be a potential problem .
At a time , when they expect spectacular customer experiences and for those experiences , and seemingly seemingly seemingly seemingly play a pivotal .
That is because in a world full of choices , why would anyone accept a bad customer experience if a better one might accept it ?
Trust me , this is something I know a fair bit about .
At Acrolinx we recently can a whole bunch of research about content , but now .
This blog came out for the purposes of the blog post .
You have to appreciate that content consistency .
Here is why . It plays a huge role in shaping and generally want those experiences to be consistent .
For example , for example , for example , for example , having a consistent experience across all brand touch is a key driver of brand trust .
This is more important - making the point is a recent study by study by McKinsey .
The bands The Guess Where were that a findings experience across the entire customer increases customer , and boosts , and boosts .
If you accept that having consistent consistent consistent is important , you may be surprised as to how few companies actually have it .
As part of our research , we looked at the content of 170 .
I have a lot of trust , including one-fifth .
Everyone else either had inconsistent content , low-quality or worst of all .
That 's a big problem for those companies because it can confuse their customers that they 're sold to by many different people than one unified .
They can damage their brand .
If you want to know more about content consistency and it is role in shaping , shaping . How can the World 's Leading .
At Acrolinx . We recently published the second , it 's of our biography Content , if you missed the first report published this year .
In this latest latest latest latest , we looked at how consistent brands are with their content .
The door Acrolinx 's linguistic , we examined the websites of 170 , studying the different types of content they produce .
We wanted to measure the extent to which individual companies can vary within individual companies .
That is because while it is consistently high level of content that is not only accurate and has a successful voice , it is difficult to achieve a successful brand and maintaining brand brand .
To determine , we used the Acrolinx platform to score the unique sections , including companies , including us , news , and support content .
We calculated next between the highest and lowest scoring within the highest and their content was n't .
Based on our research , we experience that companies with a variance , or less have content that 's sufficiently to help them .
On the other hand , companies with a variance of variance to suffer as a result of that inconsistency .
At a very high level of high level , the diagram below , the diagram below , below the diagram of the companies we sampled .
Every company 's content is either either inconsistent or worst of all .
This is a problem , especially when it comes to creating positive experiences experiences .
Why does content matter ?
I believe it is important for a number of reasons .
When the quality of your content is not consistent , it can confuse your customers , giving them the impression that they 're rather sold to a lot of different people .
That in turn can damage your brand .
When your content is consistently good , it helps create better customer experiences , it helps create better experiences , which in turn , credibility , and a great reputation .
It is some recent research from McKinsey , and Company helps to make the point .
On the graphic below the graphic shows , there is a lot of correlation in customer and having a consistent customer journey .
The particular research is specific to the banking , but we believe that there are similar industry every industry .
Would you like to find out more ?
I found the report that I have only scratched in this post in our recent research .
For large companies that have a lot of people creating content across , departments , our findings , and our findings .
We certainly surprised to see how much content quality can vary — . — even at highly regarded brands .
About learning Content , more about content content and want to see the full results of our research .
Next year , you should stay tuned for the next report in this series .
It 's almost that time of year , but Content is coming up on September , but it 's 8-11 .

When the session Andrew and Steve are going to talk about what it is like to do content marketing .
I want to give you a sense of the sense of the scale of the scale of the scale in their mind , but just consider that they have over 4,000 across countries .
While not the focus of the presentation , I should mention that is one of our biggest issues around the world using our platform creators .

If you are a content marketer and you are trying to scale your content marketing marketing , one of the biggest decisions you need .
You have two main options . Both of those have pros and cons .
You can either create your content in house or outsource in a task .
You do n't have to choose one option to the exclusion of both .
Let us take a look at the ups and downs of each option to find out .
You can understand the case if it 's easy to make the case that everyone works out for marketing .
Why spend your precious budget dollars when you can turn your precious budget when you can turn to help with your content creation .
The reality is that since everyone in your company is in some way responsible for trying to engage in your program , and engage in them and engage them as content in the way them engage in the ability to fuel your program .
Not only that , as they are as close to your business as can be and are therefore therefore therefore your company 's tone is true , and that provides unique value .
It is a great plan , at least in theory .
In practice , however , relying is on your colleagues for content more challenging .
The reality is that most people are not good writers , that is getting them to create content for you that you can actually publish .
A hurdle is a hurdle with the proper training , however , this is a hurdle .
In addition , it is a significant difference , and it could result in your content marketing marketing .
I am not sure even if you have the good writers throughout your endeavors .
I understand all of your content , it can , over time , result in it becoming quite quite quite quite quite a bit .
That is hardly a formula for content that stands out , and drives it can .
Outsourcing , Content is to a Third-Party that brings us to the alternative , which brings us to the content party or an agency .
Just be a great way to keep your content and ensure someone else to create your content , can be a great way to keep your content fresh .
If you think that outsourcing your content means that outsourcing your content means that you can absolve yourself of all the responsibility and still get a great outcome .
In the contrary , these kinds of can only work well when you are in a successful outcome .
There is a learning curve to overcome here as well .
You are already will be new to your company and perhaps your industry .
They will need time to get up to speed before they are able to start creating content that really resonates with your audience .
Plus , if someone else is creating all of your content , you 're carefully at brand risk unless you are carefully carefully .
The reality is that no third-party can represent your company . It 's brand better than you .
It 's hard to understand the situation , but a bit it 's just the best idea .
If you are looking to scale your content marketing program , you will likely find that you get the best results when you do a combination of in-house .
The key is to strike the right balance and that will take some extent .
In the meantime , you can be sure , both of you have at your understand , both of them , both that can happen when you need them .
There are three main ways to develop your thoughts .
The first thing is to get a lot of practice .
You can get into the habit of writing on a regular basis and seeking feedback , so that you gradually improve improve .
You can do is devote your time to reading , such as that you absorb other writers , such as that you absorb other writers , creativity , and techniques .
Last , but not least . You can approach as though you were a student and study up using some of the great resources available available .
The best writers ever use all three techniques . In this post our goal is to help you .
We are pointing for some of the best compilations to writers that we know .
I understand skills such as 50 , Free , Resources , Will Improve your Writing , Skills , Improve skills , and other resources .
Most of the resources they have identified quite a bit of good , and they 've made it very easy to navigate to exactly what will be most helpful to you .
This is a great set of resources for anyone looking to improve the mechanics of their writing .
The best thing for a few things to do is that they crowdsourced about the resources that Lifehacker has gathered writers .
They have it a result . They have it a rich array of interesting books , videos , and tutorials that you might not be acceptable .
It is not as good as some resource , but some resource lists some gems through it .
It 's useful to check College Writing Center Harvard , Harvard 's writing Center has a number of useful resources .
I academic in nature , and at times Harvard-centric , the site still offers offers plenty of valuable advice .
We have found the section on it strategies for writing , but particularly helpful , and relatable to writing .
In addition , this audience is important to you to write .
He can be found in this guest post for the content Marketing Institute , as in this guest post of a content marketer .
We like this post because it moves past the tension of good writing and how to create content for marketing .
Also , since it is Jam Nights with Just it , it is an enjoyable read that you can easily apply to your own work .
It is possible to get together with a vast Education Database and more to Help writers .
This is certainly the most sort of resources we have found and like Smashing Magazine 's , it is well organized and easy to navigate .
Here is a list of my favorites .
The site goes smoothly , so if you are after something specific , this may be a great place to look .
We hope that you will locate these resources .
Similar to anything , you need to comb through them and identify what is most accurate .
We 're impressed with the content of all of this content and are confident if you are looking for writing resources .
Recently , we recently had the opportunity to run a Deborah Bosley .
I Southeastern States of the owner of Deborah States in the owner of The Plain Language and United States based on United States .
For more than 20 years , Deborah has worked with some of the largest companies strategies .
The Q & A follows is adapted from her presentation .
I understand Team , you do a lot of work around communication .
What is the key to good communication ?
A few things come to mind Deborah Bosley .
For example , I always encourage my opinions to others as they communicate others as they would unto themselves .
What I mean is that when you are describing something to your target audience , you should always do so in the same way that you would imagine them describing it to their friends .
That often means not talking to them like they 're subject , direct , and succinct language , and succinct .
Beyond that , I think it is always a good idea to make sure you are using your customers to answer your question .
It is also important to make sure that you get to the point quickly .
In my opinion , the best way to make sure that happens is by communicating that your audience actually needs to know .
You mentioned plain language .
What do you mean by that ?
It will make it easy to understand and use information by Plain language is the use of proven writing and design it make it easy for your intended audience .
You will notice that I mentioned the word design in my definition .
That is because plain language is about more than just the words that you use .
It is about how easy your content is to navigate visually .
Another way to think about plain language is finding ways to communicate so that it is clear , and credible .
Why is plain language important to content strategy ?
Googling are numerous reasons .
For example , depending on the industry you are working in , being able to do that , but you need plain language to do that ; effectively , you need language .
It is also a way to emphasize with your company , to make your company 's values and to better manage by people understand you .
In addition , I would add that using plain language can help you increase customer and satisfaction , satisfaction is helpful .
What can you offer for help people to help people understand that they are using plain language ?
Netflix is a lot of tips , but here are six of the most important people so people can understand them .
That means no more than 25 words in a sentence . However , it is better when you sentences just fourteen words .
Likewise , make sure that your paragraphs are also nice and short .
Without most cases , you should be able to know of no more than three to five .
You should use three to five to five to help your content easier and navigate .
I can help you to find the specific information they are after faster .
When possible , you should lay your content out into columns because it is easier for people to read text .
I can write at an eighth grade level to ensure that everyone understands you .
Last but not least , remember that design is every bit as important as language .
What impact can using plain language , does n't have on a business ?
I would advise you to give me a real-life example .
I recently worked with the financial services .
They had sent out a letter to their realize that was just hard to understand .
As a result , it is not their fault , 10,000 over the following week looking for clarification .
We subsequently understand the letter with plain language in mind and received a much better result .
In fact , feedback about the revised letter was 95 percent positive and it ultimately ultimately resulted in millions of the company .
Thank you for taking the time to talk with us today .

At Acrolinx at Acrolinx , we recently had the opportunity to host one of our fast track , I can understand Gretyl .
In her role at the address based on the legal strategy , it has worked on developing and can implementing on developing and implementing .
In our situation , she shared some of her key learnings from those experiences , focusing on why and consistency .
After the effort , you can sat down with us to talk about the key points from her fantastic presentation and which we have captured .
I Gretyl Team for taking the time to talk with us , Gretyl .
Let 's begin at the very beginning with what you definition is .
I 'm sure : Sure .
In my opinion , a content strategy is a plan that you make for how to handle your content creation .
That plan can apply to any kind of content your company 's company , marketing content , and sales , and help your business 's bottom line .
Okay , so what do you see as the key to getting a content strategy ?
GK : I would say there are two main points to keep in mind .
Your strategy needs to be tailored to your company 's specific goals .
In other words , it is important to remember that just because you see another company that seems to get results .
It does not work that way because there is no problem to content .
The other point I would stress is that good content strategies the issues that you are facing right now .
It is a great idea to take a lot of effort and help you understand that you are prepared for the future .
How can having a content strategy help companies are having a tough time , but their content ?
GK : can definitely be a challenging , but time-consuming and expensive .
It can make localization companies will help companies by forcing them to plan them so difficult .
For example , you can plan ahead to ensure that you are using terminology consistently . You are avoiding jargon and sensitive .
Just having a plan for all of that will go a long way toward saving you and your translators .
In your presentation , you went on to say that localization goes hand in hand with scalability .
How so , how so ?
I have worked with lots of companies whose content teams .
It may be possible for them to find themselves with more than with more products or with more products .
Maybe they have more than just one question or simply more requests for content .
It is fine if their content creation it can keep up with the demand , but if they can not , it 's usually a sure sign that they need a content strategy .
It 's just having a strategy that just with localization is just having a strategy that help you to always plan .
Where does fit into the equation ?
GK , Having it can be a huge problem , and one that can be a huge problem , and one that can make it localizing .
It is important to ensure that your content is in terms of language , style , and branding .
When it is , it really helps make your content all the more effective .
When it is not , it is confusing for the end user and makes your attempts to scale your content machine to a halt .
While making sure your content is obvious , it seems obvious , and it is often obvious .
Unfortunately that just leads to more problems when it comes time to make changes to your content .
What advice do you offer to help them understand that they keep their content , consistent ?
GK : I tell them they have two choices .
They first is to create a guide that defines things such as what style their writers should be using , and which terms are n't acceptable .
For that option to work , they have actually been able to enforce it is use and make sure that it is use being against the guide .
That is a lot easier than done .
The second option is to automate that whole process by using a content optimization to the company 's standard .
What is the problem of having a content strategy that allows you to more easily easily easily understand your content is and ensure you ensure your content is ?
GK : I think it is as simple as this . Because putting some upfront and money into making sure you handle how to handle things .
That , in my opinion , is worth it .
Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us .
I recently led a discussion about agile about agile .
I had the opportunity to talk with Susie Dickson , but a content strategist at Facebook .
I support Susie that she spent her entire career in content as a variety of roles in the roles of roles , since joining content in a variety of roles , in any case .
When I asked her to describe what Agile means to her , Susie said that it 's how Facebook does product .
She explained that things move really quickly that they are always changing .
In fact , the company 's mantra is to should proceed quickly .
As a result , she and her team have to move quickly to both create create content evolving .
When I pressed her to explain why being agile in an important culture , she said that when you are not able to move quickly .
Not only that . If the content is not created in real time you are being developed product experiences .
No one wants that .
Next , I asked her how being agile the next way that gets created at Facebook .
Her response was that it means that you can not create content in a vacuum .
Instead , you need to be part of an overall process and that you must be able to iterate .
To do that successfully , content creators like Susie are not part of content teams .
They have worked to build strong relationships with the product team and are actually embedded within those types of teams .
One of the keys to her success at Facebook has been partnering .
Doing so has allowed to gather her to gather things about how specific pieces of content are performing , whether or not people are interacting with the content .
It 's not always possible to be agile .
One exception that Susie points when working with the company 's legal team .
I 'm trying to work too fast with lawyers that you can be painful because it means that you wind up having to make it too many .
That is because it is for a pace of knowing that it is because Susie puts it . At the end of the day , legal teams .
If you would like to hear for yourself , what Susie and the other panelists , Moody 's Analytics , and have to say about agile .
At Acrolinx we know just how important language is .
It is how people communicate , form connections , and other important ideas .
It is at the heart of our business and at the core of what we do every day .
We know that language is the key to making information , such as to everyone , and that to do so to communicate with people in their own language .
Those are just a couple of reasons why we are proud of a very important , organization Without Borders .
I can Handicap in health , by Lori 's Hunger and the other Smith-Thomas and Ros Smith-Thomas .
You have translated over over 100 languages in 100 languages .
Do non-profit without Borders provides local language speakers ?
This often happens in crisis , I wonder if this often happens in quickly . Do assembled in quickly .
I understand the pain that recently was rocked .
Their own Andrew Bredenkamp , who has chaired of Borders .
Believe it , in the situation , there are many people who do not speak English and it is these have been most badly affected by the earthquake .
The translation of the team is translation , aid by enabling , and enabling .
There are just a few examples of some work that Translators that Translators : Without Borders has done in the short time , Newari and Hindi workers monitoring .
Why sanctioned and sanctioned in first aid and sanctioned ?
I can not search and rescue by translating , by translating and categorizing .
It can be repaired from English to Nepali .
I believe it is distributed distributed and distributed ‘ on earthquake and distributed service .
It is also working on a number of other projects as well .
For example , it is leading the right 100x100 , an ambitious ambitious ambitious ambitious widely widely read Wikipedia articles to read Wikipedia articles to much of the world .
Many articles have been translated into a growing into growing number of languages .
I am in partnership with The Open University , but in partnership with the goal of training with the goal of training , 2016 is frontline .
It 's helping translating is helping by translating .
I am currently trying to work on it at a million point of training materials in it .
We are very proud to support Translators and encourage you to consider getting involved with this important path .

Recently , we recently had the opportunity to sit down with Laurel Counts , Laurel Counts , and analysis .
To being a Acrolinx , earlier this year , earlier this year , this year Laurel participated , where she shared some of her ideas about Moody 's ideas .
As the head of a global team that is responsible for the product , she 's a content development and UI .
If you Moody 's conversation about her conversation about her conversation about her conversation without Moody .
I Acrolinx Team us , Laurel , what exactly does mean to you ?
It should depend on most people , but most people , agile is about adapting and being able to iterate .
I think it plays a bit differently .
Even though it is a tendency to fit into agile , it is a tendency to fit into product , however , it is something that was created for product .
It 's a different world .
When I think of technical it , communications and agile . I think of making our documentation and push them out to our clients .
Okay , you alluded to the need to the need for speed more than once .
Why do you think velocity is so important ?
LC , it 's all about time to market and competition .
I believe Analytics is Analytics software to help companies address the numerous address and United States .
The new things are always coming out and there are numerous numerous companies that are competing to act in this space .
For that reason , velocity is critical because we want to get ahead whenever we can .
How does it velocity and being it change the way that content gets created ?
I started at Moody 's four years ago , and I started at Moody 's four years ago .
They were literally just working off in the corner .
I have done a lot of work to make them part of the product team .
That allows them to be more certain , and make hints quickly . That is what you need when you are working in understand .
On a day-to-day basis , my team is a part of the larger product .
I always encourage my writers to be active in terms of meetings in terms of trying to assess the product team .
Do you think you have noticed all of this agile that you are doing ?
I think it is a work in progress .
I do n't think they would have noticed a couple of years ago , but as we move forward , we move forward .
Neil Patel recently wrote a great blog post for the sake of Marketing and what you Should Do About It .
If you have not seen it yet , it is a fantastic piece of piece .
In it , Neil explains that one of the reasons why content matters so much is because it is critical to get good search results .
He makes the argument that one of the most important reasons is because content quality is because content is so important .
We see an important way to expand on it .
We are talking about what content quality quality is .
In the article , Neil 's definition primarily revolves around technical specifications , specifications .
There is no doubt that these and the other factors are listed are important , and that search engines will reward you .
However , let 's not forget an important point : Fundamentally quality quality comes down to how well your content is written .
Neil hints at this time , he will contact you in the expert level .
However , he seems to be primarily focused on how sophisticated someone is on a particular subject rather than how well they write .
For our part , we believe that successful you are at using language language is equally important to building the search engines .
We are talking about things as well as more sophisticated aspects of writing and tone of voice .
This is a point made in a recent article about SEO .
In it Tyler Collins , the head of a head of a SEO , explains that to rank and 100 % unique and original and original original .
I believe they must read smoothly , and give the information they are looking for .
With this , Tyler gives the writing aspect of content the attention that we wish Neil had .
It is more important to making the point in the search of the news in the search of the news in the search engine `` Bing ' last year '' last year .
Their logic , of course , is that all other things being equal , search engines , and that is easy to consume , that is simple .
It stands to reason that Bing is not the only one taking into account with it .
So Neil , we hope that in your next post about SEO and content quality quality .
While it may never be the key driver of search , we believe that in an increasingly content rich world , it will increasingly become one of the factors rank .
It 's hard to always focus on writing their organic , it 's an important reminder to always focus on good writing .
A recent blog post from the people over at at HubSpot and how critical it is to ensure .
I staunch of the the content of the importance of the content of content in the forms of content in the forms of content in the e-mail included immediately .
In the post , you can HubSpot from the Radicati . Radicati that nearly 140 billion business business .
That is a lot of mistakes , but anyone whose inbox fills .
To prove the point , it is hard to prove people between the ages of 18 and level of education impacted their preferences .
The results were led to two people that are particularly interesting to us .
The first will not come as a surprise to anyone .
People prefer emails to longer , I can not guess those .
It 's been long to HubSpot that shorter subject lead to better than 24 percent on the length of your e-mails .
I believe 60 percent of it can not occur while less than 30 percent of the respondents .
In our opinion , part of the good writing is being concise .
It 's findings , validate how important this is in everyday life when it comes to e-mail .
The second and even more interesting finding from our perspective is how much the quality of your writing matters to people .
It turns out that errors in spelling and grammar are among the most , but the most important things are off .
In fact , according to HubSpot , nearly 80 percent of respondents and grammatical .
Just be single and 70 percent agree . It should also be avoided .
fail to find spelling in the 1980s .
The research is limited to an email , but we believe it is another proof point that speaks to a universal truth matters and will play a huge role in how well .
You are your content 's quality 's quality , your content 's quality is the quality of quality quality , and punctuation .
If you go to a step beyond them , you will get to things like tone of voice , style , and readability , all of which have a role to play in determining how effective you are in determining your content .
I can guess from all of this simple .
When it comes to your content , you have to be vigilant or risk being being worse or degrading .
Basically controlling this on an individual can be challenging enough unless you have the right technology .
You should research more on the topic of content on the topic of content around the topic of content around the world .
I can not recall it , but color-iopl is % % % % 3A % 2Fwww.acrolinx.com : DOWNLOAD .
It seems like everywhere . You look there around content marketing marketing .
Some of them are interesting , but others seem to be noise .
In this blog post , we have it some of our favorite content statistics icon into a single list .
It 's not comprehensive . However , if there are any great statistics that you have seen we have already seen about them — .
Even though there are future ado , here are the 23 stats… , and here are 23 % of CMOs , Trends .
Believe it , 83 % of B2B . It is marketers . However , use 10 marketing marketing to receive 10 marketing touches through the course of a successful buyer .
I believe Marketing 82 Only 31 percent of brands exceeded score percent of business , CMI/MarketingProfs .
I Statista ) , it is all About Getting Results . It 's a new customer tactics , as long as many people are examining the success of their content .
At least Less of 20 % of a company 's website drives 90 % of a website traffic .
I can guess marketing % Inbound 54 % leads than traditional outbound .
I believe Brain . I can not understand the target audience because the topic is irrelevant .

We recently had the opportunity to talk with Ben Cornelius , the director of content , the director of content is long-time .
The teams is responsible for 20 years and is responsible for global years .
This includes the transliteration from English into a variety of other languages , so it can make sense to audiences around the world .
If you get better results in our discussion about how PayPal has mastered it , for customers to get better results .
Why exactly Team : what exactly does mean to you ?
It is about rapid planning , development planning , and release .
It is also about getting feedback as possible .
To put it another way , it is about being nimble and able to take on your company 's next release .
Okay , and why is being it so important for your business ?
BC : to be honest , we really have no other choice .
It is driven by both our opinions , and by international regulations .
It is a problem that we have to hit .
If we do not , we are putting our minds at risk with our ability to help our ability to help our ability to help our ability to help our existing payments .
For that reason , it is critical for us to be agile .
Also , being it gives us the opportunity to address people with our content based on what they are looking for .
For example , we interact with hundreds of teams globally to be different to 203 countries .
Without Agile , that just would not be possible .
How does being agile change the way that content gets created ?
Watch , because it is part of what we deliver to our thoughts because it is part of the experience experience .
We work hand in hand with nothing but product , product , marketing , and every other team across our customers .
Because I am helping them in their goals to achieve their goals , those teams and see it as a great partnership .
At PayPal , we think of content at PayPal .
I am certain that we do our planning with the software , however .
As a new products are being defined , we are already defined as well and thinking about what content we can create .
It actually helps to break down .
How does need for it to work when it comes time to practice when it comes time to partner with a development team ?
Watch `` When we engage with development , '' we use simple tools that we built to look at , repositories .
We go into all of the management command and control , therefore , our engineering and product teams .
In other words , we get very deep with them from planning on .
This way , by the time that they already know most of the things that need to get done .
That will help us better help them .
It sounds as if you have managed to role your sleeves up and get your hands into the source code , but repositories is to get a hold of the content you care about .
That is great .
BC , and we have made it simple so the people on my team are not looking at ugly , XML , but rather at what seems like the PayPal .
The only difference is that they can click into it and change the words in real time .
Is Agile always a good thing ?
Where should you not pursue it ?
BC , the short answer is that there is no team for which Agile is not a good thing .
The long answer is that it is more complicated with the lawyers .
I am trying to remain in fact while working with our lawyers is one of our biggest issues .
To get around that , we try to make their lives easy so they want to do the work and do so to do so quickly .
It means making sure they have a visual problem for what particular strings are going to look like to users so they know what they are .
What is it impossible to benefited from you ? Have your understanding and have your understanding ?
Watch `` Our internal can have definitely noticed '' .
They no longer come to me saying things such as `` your team is late , '' '' '' '' '' '' They are n't here , '' and `` I 'm going to miss my release , or at revenue . ''
Their problem is happy because we do heavy things .
Since we 're a heavily level industry we need to do analytics , and rather look at that burden .
For example , when we change words , I can show people when there is an increase in internal payments .
In reality , we are able to show the business value of our content through the customer experiences .
Everyone understands that .
That is great Ben .
Thank you for taking the time to chat with us today .
I believe this year we surveyed more than 1000 marketers .
Our goal was to see what we could gain by asking about their content , consistency and tone of voice .
In this post , we are sharing some of the raw data that we can understand and why it is important .
To kick off the survey , we wanted to characterize on how their personality is .
Most people say it was either warm and friendly , and polished , it is important to remember that these results .
If you were to look at their companies , their content is very different .
Next , we wanted to know how their customer-facing is in terms of terms of tone and voice .
If you are a regular reader of this blog , you will know the way it is on this front .
Not just in terms of marketing content , but rather all the different types of content that companies create .
The results are more important , though whether or not they are an accurate reflection of reality .
The issue is that we only surveyed for marketing content .
Because Big can have many different people creating content , these sit outside of marketing , these impressions may not reflect the reality for their entire company .
Either our respondents , or our respondents is questionable .
All the more , so when you consider the results of our next questions .
When we asked marketers how important they think style and tone are in terms of content , effectiveness it was either important or very important .
Also , as the next chart shows less than half of respondents , had comprehensive guidelines for their messaging , language , and tone .
It reveals a pretty significant amount because it reveals a pretty significant gap .
I believe all of the marketers marketers that style and tone are important , yet in place that document what they should be .
One single one has the ability to do certain things , among 32 percent of the people that do not understand the issues and can recall .
Do the math and you 'll discover that means that only 14 percent of the world is consistently being used .
For anyone who is trying to create it at scale , that is a problem .
The takeaway from all of this is simple : underwear and tone matter , but most people are not giving it the attention it deserves .
The question is , are you ?
There are friends at EContent .
We were all related to discover that you included included the fourth companies that are in the digital consecutive consecutive year .
I believe it is an honor to be acknowledged alongside industry industry , Netflix , Facebook , and Amazon.com .
And we ca n't help but think that more important than that recognition is what it means that lists like this even exist .
For us personally , it is a validation that we are on the right path by trying to help companies , more consistent , so that they can speak with one voice .
In my opinion , we are more mature , though we think it just goes to show you how important companies are and management .
The truth is that content is now the best way to have communicating with their opinions .
For that reason , you have to be sure that the content you are creating is effective and that you are doing everything you can get it in front of the right people at the right times .
That is obviously easier said than done , but there is no shortage of resources to help .
However , it is possible that magazine has been reminding us all of the resources for fifteen years .
They have certainly changed during that time , but that just shows you how much the digital content has matured .
Well , as all of that has remained consistently true .
The digital world has forever changed and it is more important than ever before .

If I had to dive into the five , essential steps to epic content to epic content .
I want you to go way in your memory when websites first came about .
It was a great moment for marketers , was n't it ?
We finally had a place where we could post information about our products and services in the hope of money .
Their media was added to the mix of content with other forms of content such as blogs .
In the years since we have learned an important lesson , no one cares !
Unless they are already already deep within the buying process , our customers , and prospects , but prospects between our products and services , or about our services .
Thank you to the explosion of channels available to consumers to understand over the past few before .
If you think back , you might recall that prior to 1990 's , there were only eight channels you could use to reach mail and display .
I had a number of ways to get information and , as a result of ways to get information and use any of these channels .
Of course we all know , that is no longer the case .
What is passed away ?
Just to today and there are literally hundreds of different channels that consumers can use access to access to access .
I am talking about everything from Wikis and to RSS and RSS .
Currently , they are not only required to have access to most of the information they need , but they can also control what they do .
This shift has had an important impact on how people make it decisions .
If you look at the research of the folks from folks at Altimeter , and Gartner and Gartner through the company they intend to buy from .
That means that as long as we want to influence their emotions process , we have to be much more effective and compelling .
That is where content marketing marketing comes into .
Instead of communicating with your thoughts of your channels , content content is about creating and distributing .
Even more and more companies are embracing it , the reality is that most have not yet cracked the code .
That is why I think the advice below is so important for getting started on the right path to a successful content program program .
In my opinion , 5 is not easy to get in the situation marketing .
It is a marathon , not a Sprint , that takes focus , and patience .
It is also important that you have a documented strategy .
If you create your strategy to help you , you need to be thinking about before you create your strategy , right ?
Take some time to understand your purpose .
You can do so to drive sales , cut sales , or to do what I like to refer to as creating sunshine sunshine .
Each of these is a valid reason to pursue content marketing .
The key is to just being crystal clear about which one is driving your efforts .
The fact is that most companies do not know why they are doing everything they are doing , which leads to wasted and a lack of focus .
For that reason , I encourage you to try the following exercise .
Create the particular audience you are thinking .
Insert the left-hand list of the ways that you communicate with that audience , blog , blog , posts , etc .
Next , next to one , jot is down the business reason for why you 're using that particular channel to communicate .
In my experience , no one is ever able to explain everything they are doing .
You are going through this exercise not only makes potential activities that you can cut from your program clear , but also helps .
That 's information that you need to pass along to the people in the situation , so that they understand how their efforts are .
Create a content marketing statement before you can create and document your content strategy . You need to develop a mission statement .
That in turn will save time by eliminating confusion .
You 're your mission statement , your mission needs to include three parts , and what the outcome is for your audience .
When you develop a relationship , remember that you will need one for each individual that you are targeting .
If you try to go after multiple people with a single statement , I promise you that it will be a recipe for failure .
Use a proven content formula . I 've seen a lot of different approaches to content marketing , but I can not Content about the Main and a long worker .
In order to be in a long term like a king , a king is a like to be a king and a similar approach to a celebrity .
It can be hard to blog at the same time each week or more to help your audience .
I am certain that marketing is a marathon and not a disc , so it is simply focused on all the difference .
Do not build your content on rented land If you are reliant on other people 's content channels , they can change the rules at any time .
After all , each of these platforms is constantly changing .
I definitely encourage you to use social media .
Rather than focus on developing massive massive , I recommend focusing on building massive , followings on these and other channels .
It is the only way to be in control of what happens .
If you are able to figure out what behavioral occur between people who occur between people , who subscribe to you .
You should open up your wallet and be more interactive .
People often think that they have to build their own audience from scratch , when in fact buying that audience may be a faster , cheaper and easier alternative .
It is a difficult situation that companies like HubSpot , among others , and that you could also .
You put all of your effort into building an audience , weigh your options .
Make a list of the other blogs , websites , and other channels .
You should evaluate if there may be an opportunity to partner with any of them .
It could be a better approach , but over the long run it may be a better approach .
Create Your Plan . I believe you will be able to understand and play Content marketing .
It is not possible to results in that plan in place , staying focused on place , and delivering focused on it .
Once you have your plan , you can start growing a community of followers or understand .
My final piece of advice is to make sure you always treat your content as an asset as an asset .
In many cases content content is still just as a cost , rather than something with tremendous value .
When you are able to shift that mindset within your mind , you will truly succeed .
The road to successful content is a long one , but if you follow the advice , I promise you will get much better results .
I have seen it work for dozens and dozens .
It is official .
I Oxford Dictionaries of the Year 's 2015 .
Not in the traditional sense at least .
either , they have it that honor on the emoji known as , `` That face with tears of joy of joy , '' said here .
Before you get too tired about it , the folks at Oxford about it , the folks at Oxford , and preoccupations of 2015 .
Who knew ?
It is an interesting choice for Oxford , but one that makes sense on it .
However , emojis emojis for a while ( they date back to the late , 1990s . )
I feel that you do not have to look any further than Apple .
They have introduced many of new people in recent months as long as part of their software updates .
In June Chevrolet , made the news when it issued a press release entirely in emojis .
By the way , apparently the Chevy Cruze does not elicit of joy .
I emoji is notably from the release .
If you look at all of this from the perspective of how languages — , and as a bunch of language geeks , that is a pretty fascinating change in how we communicate .
It 's difficult for people to are time to emojis and are often a faster way of communicating .
They are awfully fun , correct ?
That is fine and good for texting your girlfriend .
It 's more widely accepted to try and move toward it .
However , how far do we go with that and is there a place for our business communication ?
As a content , why are we unable to say what is or is it not right ?
We are concerned with style , tone of voice , and consistency .
Your content with a liberal coating will certainly have an effect on your brand , maybe it 's not such a bad thing .
Do you believe ?
Please update me .
Perhaps you would be happier with one of the things ?
The purpose is to Brexit , the word contenders of the year departing Dark economy .
I believe it is a funny thing .
It 's constantly evolving . When we may not always like each of the changes , one thing is for sure .
If you do not embrace most of them , you will quickly start to sound dated and out of touch .
Overall , you might even be viewed irrelevant .
That is not an option most of us care , so perhaps it is time to start opening our minds instead .
No matter what your political views may be , if you are a content geek like we are , you have got to hand it to the US Government Act into least one thing .
This officially started it agencies to make their communication clearer so that they would be easier for the public to understand .
In January , after , the government can an government issued stating that all the government issued language , and easy to understand .
Perhaps you are thinking , so what ?
If you ever had a reason to read government content , you know how difficult it can be to make sense of .
In fact , they can be down right confusing , leaving you scratching your head as you are through all the passive voice , and many lots of jargon .
Because the Plain Writing Act does not include any occurrence mechanism , you might assume that the whole thing is nothing more than a bunch of lip service .
Over the past few years the Center for Plain Language has stepped up to fill this role of their writing .
This is a part of that process , and a group of readers score the writing samples against a set of language criteria .
The Center for Plain Language also uses it to analyze the content in terms of grammar .
The output of their writing design is a report card that rates it is a report card that allows the Plain Writing Act and information .
In Plain Language it just happens Federal Language Report in the past this month .
I am curious how to government .
We know that you can be the good news , is that things are generally at all-time high school , with 23 agencies , submitting .
I believe scores have it overall with eight agencies , but four others dropped .
There is 13 agencies , in fact , in fact writing and information design while only five dropped .
There were no Ds or Fs ; instead , a record number of agencies scored B or higher .
Of course , there is work to be done .
I style a report from the Center for Plain language notes that , `` Plain language notes that , overly technical style with an technical language , but much style . ''
We are excited that the United States government recognizes of clear and easy to understand writing and we are thrilled to be a part of this great .
It can be understood who comes out on the 2016 but we dive deeper into the 2016 to easily be understood .
We were recently recently discover that the people over at Docurated and have recognized their own content tools in the business .
It is an honor to have made their list along with tons of great companies , OutBrain .

That is because it 's yet point about just how important content has become , and the intense focus are putting on making sure that theirs is the best .
Take a look at all of the amazing companies that have emerged in the last few few years to support content and distribution .
By Docurated to points out , it is the content that holds your many marketing marketing and sales .

Even though it is our annual virtual user last November , Dr. Andrew Bredenkamp , and panel about agile .
Things where are three professionals . All of those are leading , agile development development brands .
The bands include Susie , Dickson , Dickson , content at Facebook , strategist .
In this post , we have tried to capture the discussion that Andrew had with these folks and why is so important to you .
If you are interested in learning more about this topic , you can also access the full panel here .
Andrew : please start at the beginning .
What does actually mean for each of your businesses ?
Susie : It 's just how we do things at Facebook because we believe there 's really no other way to do product .
The company 's mantra has long , been `` Move faster and break things '' and we have built our culture around that day .
What it comes down to is that as a company we would take an open approach .
That would imply that anyone who is working on our products needs to be aligned with that mentality .
Since we see : At Moody 's Analytics , we see agile as a way to gain an advantage with new products .
It Facebook at Facebook . Where it sounds like it has been part of the company 's DNA on agile .
It 's only in the last couple of years , that agile it has made our technical thoughts .
On our perspective at CA , being agile .
We live in an application economy where software is literally changing .
If your company can not keep up with that kind of occurrence , you will be going to be dead in the water .
Andrew : Jim , you mentioned , which is what being agile .
Why do you think velocity is so important in the first place ?
I believe velocity is the key to meeting customer demands .
For that to work , a company needs to be agile .
What good is having a super fast team if it takes months to get the content to support it ?
Andrew , what have you found to be the keys to making things work ?
Susie : for us there have been a few things .
First of all , you 've got to have good communication between the different teams and divisions .
Even that alone is not enough .
You 've got to figure out how you can get yourselves embedded so that you become a part of their product .
That way becomes a natural part of the discussion rather than the discussion .
In three things , I would say it is about three things . The good internal collaboration : `` The good internal collaboration , that Susie just learning that you offload and having a strong customer '' feedback from the process .
I agree with the answer .
Getting our get writers into the process has been really important as has been adopting the right tools .
Without technology , the kind of can automation about it , just would n't be possible .
Andrew : has being agile the dynamics within your organization ?
Jim : Hell !
We are much more sure now as a result .
Just one of my interested writers like a gift is a king or a similar process . We have now got a collaborative .
This process allows us to crowdsource from the relevant parties from our support , services in our support services .
Their writers are becoming content , but it is not .
Susie are dating a similar experience .
On Our content of and content teams were previously in different silos .
I think that is a reflection of how we are maturing as a company and it has certainly allowed us to try new things .
You need to have your problem noticed any changes as a result of your being agile .
It depends on We have n't fully rolled out agile agile at Moody .
Girls have not noticed any changes in our technical communication yet , I would say that they have noticed a lot of problems .
Jim : For sure are noticing and we see that in a couple of ways .
For example , they are leaving positive comments and giving us higher net promoter scores .
Also , we are seeing a certain thing as we were using the content volume as we are using to satisfy their needs through understand .
Susie : However , it is hard to tie anything back to agile , but I think our ability to keep up with customer demands .
It is a great approach to almost any complex business process .
To find out more about how it can be , Moody is Analytics , and CA are using agile here .
Last year we had the chance to hear from Jim Turcotte about his experiences .
This SVP will take Executive at California , Technologies , and Acrolinx .
In fact , in his current role , he oversees about a team that supports approximately 3,000 audiences for global audiences .
It Acrolinx on Jim 's participation in Jim 's participation in a discussion .
I Acrolinx Team : Let 's start with the basics , Jim .
What do mean to you ?
Jim Turcotte is all about rapid planning , development and release .
Most people tend to think of agile , but it actually has a much bigger application .
In today 's world , you have to think more about how your entire company can be agile .
It has to be an issue that is all aspect of every aspect of the business — faster and become more efficient across across the board .
You mentioned doing things faster .
Why do you think velocity is so important ?
If you think about it , we live in an application economy .
Everyone 's digital and mobile presence has become a big part of their brand loyalty .
Just consider companies such as Uber or any of the banking .
They are driven by software and have practically appeared out of thin air to disrupt the situation .
I believe it is important because things are moving so quickly as those examples do .
As a business , you have to do everything you can keep up .
That is where agile comes in , but , to my earlier point , it can not just be your developers .
Your whole company should embrace it .
How does agile velocity and being agile at CA ?
We are moving toward what I call an Uber approach to creating technical content .
Basically that means that anyone in the enterprise can contribute to our technical content or simply writing content .
In the meantime , our writers are now in the same situation ; all of which has greatly problems .
Also , we are moving toward continuous thoughts .
My writers do not stop once the product goes out the door .
That is because we have built it into the doctor Pro .
What we want is real-time .
In fact , we are in the process of integrating so we can take analytics .
For example , we can look at every search a customer is making and what UI is executing those searches .
That allows us to create an instant heat so that we can go in and take immediate action .
It is really key .
You have to be able to recognize where it is struggling , tactical to take quick , tactical to address there .
What has the reaction as had the reaction , `` You can Technologies to your adoption of agile , '' development ?
The 're We 're definitely getting positive feedback .
This is a perspective , the reaction has been great because our technical content has been great because our technical language to our products contextually .
It is blown away because they 're suddenly getting away by the analytics because they 're suddenly getting greater insight into their customers .
Free marketing is now using technical content as opposed to another pool .
That 's because our content is optimized for search and it 's almost all open to the public .
People are finding it , and it is a result , finding their way into our sales .
It sounds like you are doing great things at California .
Thank you for sharing some of your time .
I HubSpot at online , is based on a presentation that Kelly , HubSpot , and gave at Content .

It is not always easy to get consistently good results when you work with vendors to translate your content .
It may be really good at translating or type of content , but not another .
As a result , you never know if you are going to wind up with a piece of content that reads beautifully , that reads it slapped together with Google Translate .
It is not good enough to be successful at content for a global audience .
I believe it has a number of steps that you can take to help , ensure that you can take great results .
I believe that she believes that the root of most translation is trust , but that is the case .
I translators agencies and translators and translators .
You do not ever know who is on the other side of the wall and what exactly they are doing .
Her advice is to do everything you can break that wall `` wall so they get a better understanding of both the things , and the translators they employ . ''
For instance , she has the following suggestions . Please ask for references or referrals .
You can talk to marketers at the companies whose content you admire and see if they can refer to you .
When you do , ask them what they like about their translation , and whether or not they think they would be a good fit for your company .
Please , you can ask to see what happened .
Do not just assume the agency is picking the best .
Ask for candidates resumes so that you can look for if they have the qualities you look for when hiring .
Do they have the right experience in your industry ?
I believe sample can be found through it .
The best way to get a clear indication of the quality of a translator is to review some samples .
You can get direct access to the translator .
You need to make sure you are open to open lines and direct access to the translators .
If the weather is always the right things , things can easily easily get lost in translation .
That . You will also want to understand the nature of the translator 's relationship with the right relationship , such as how long they have been working on . How long they have been working on . How long ?
It is recommends recommends the following questions as part of the part of the content you need translated .
Do they have any subject expertise and experience it in the same way that you are working in the same way that you are working ?
Do they have time in your desired language ?
Note : they will always answer yes , so you will want to know how much experience they have .
Please ask about volume volume and remember .
Do they already get projects with the countries to ?
Can they support any technology you might be using ?
It is the problem easily , can you not just in your time zone ?
Once you have done your due , you are confident with your side to help , it is time to take some advice on your side to help ensure you get a great result .
If it comes to translations , there are a lot of truth to the old adage garbage .
In my opinion , the quality of your job is by improving the quality of your job and giving your translators .
To do so , it has a few suggestions : Look up a clear description of your target audience and pass the translator to the translator .
This will give the translator a better photo of who they are translating for .
Always explain the purpose to the translator , so they know exactly what it is intended to communicate .
The more possible thing they have , the more effective they will be at the task at hand .
I believe any terms in this situation can be found in any way you use so that the translator can find the correct spelling .
Make sure that you highlight your ability to highlight any terms you choose .
Teach source of content writers to write translatability in mind .
Do everything else using avoiding sentences , avoiding colloquialisms and doing everything you can ensure .
Focus on planning more than process more than process more than process the planning piece of advice .
That means having all of your ducks in a row , which includes things like sharing your goals .
I have detailed detailed company of a detailed detailed detailed company of having detailed company , and I can understand their quality in part of their quality . It can occur to ensure you are working in and can review their quality .
I believe Nataly believes that the key to getting great results is building a strong relationship .
As with that as a foundation , she has found that the chances of consistently positive outcomes .

When it comes to producing content in multiple languages , a machine translation is located .

Depending on the language , it depends on the language and can often result in the content of the content .
That intales a sufficient issue and simple cost .
With creating any document for translation , the trick to keeping your costs down is making sure your source is really good .
The way that machine translation works is pretty simple .

Let me begin this post with a quick story .
We like to do at Velocity is take our team away for the weekend .
I had a recent trip to Rome , and I was in charge of finding a restaurant for dinner .
After poking around on , I identified as a promising options .
Of the restaurants that responded one really stood out , though not for the reasons you might think .
The woman who wrote me started off by upsetting me by pointing out why her restaurant might not be the ideal choice .
We were looking for a private room for the dinner , which she went to great lengths to explain she could n't provide .
We needed some vegetarian options . It was not their specialty .
What I liked about the woman was that she was proactively .
Honestly , honest .
It caught my attention because it can two things to me .
First , she did not want us to be disappointed and was more concerned with our having a great time than making a quick time .
The second thing was that I was thinking that anything positive she had to say about her restaurant , a great wine list , had to be true .
If they were not , she was so honest that she had told me so .
As it turns out , I wound choosing this restaurant and we had a great meal and a fantastic time .
It was her honesty that cinched .
When Insanely is Honest . The point of that story is that being honest is incredibly powerful .
To be clear , I am not talking about normal honesty , you know where you are and professional .
I hope that 's table stakes .
I am talking about being honest and honest .
honesty is a choice , honesty is a choice , and once you have made it you really have to go out of your way to do it .
That is because you have not had to understand your weaknesses , but also be prepared to share them openly .
It is an unusual thing for marketers and to think about , but we all should be .
What can be better than signaling in their target audience ?
What could be more of it than for your target audience to know that they can trust everything you say ?
It is pretty powerful .
Young reasons , why should you put your instinct in order to reap , to reap about the benefits of the benefits and your content .
If you put a spotlight on your weaknesses , and acknowledge that you do n't do well or who your product is for .
In other words , I am guessing that you put your worst foot forward .
That sounds insane , does that sound silly ?
Why would it work ?
Here are six reasons . It surprises and charms .
People expect typical marketing , so when you use insane honesty , you are breaking that convention .
That gets their attention and as we all know , attention is the content drug of content .
It is critically important and using the element of surprise that insane , honesty is one of the best ways to get it .
Also , it makes you more charming .
People do not like people who are self-effacing .
The same holds true for brands .
This signals it is .
I like an immense amount and believe in marketing .
I see it being a combination of confidence ( being good at what you do ) and knowing it , attitude is passionate and believing that what you are writing matters .
Most likely , Insane honestly gives your content the big one of mojo .
It builds trust .
Trust is the purpose of marketing .
When most of us see marketing marketing , no matter what form of the situation , it does n't matter immediately .
Believe it , insane honesty provides the effort to that problem .
It can happen if you are less likely .
That may sound like a bad thing at first , but it is not .
If you think about how expensive and marketing efforts are particularly in B2B , B2B is a good thing .
It means not having to waste time and budget on people who are not ever going to buy from you or who will be unhappy .
It attracts you to your ideal path .
An ideal prospect is someone who truly values you and does not care about your weaknesses .
Be insanely . You will be much more likely to find those great , I 'm not sure .
It matters on battles that you can win .
This last point is quite a bit of summary .
Being insanely means no longer trying to be all people .
It 's about accepting who you are and recognizing that when you do so , those you really are the best choice for them .
My advice is to get out there and try being insanely .
Perhaps you begin with it by writing it down and see what feels like .
When you are ready , try publishing .
They say honesty is the best policy when it comes to content marketing . Nothing could be more true .
It 's the third post in a series about why CMOs is the third post in a series .
It Chain to highlight some of the key , findings , in a new report and findings .
The previous post in this series was about why managing is about why managing is a critical business issue .
I marketers to produce , and manage , and distribute content , but successfully distribute content in their content , marketers .
In a new report from a new report , is the only way that they can begin to reduce the performance of their are enhancing .
It is simplifying to doing so , the report finds it is simplifying , and automating .
The good news is that many of the marketing things are consulted from the report and import industries .
They are even setting up , understand .
In fact , over 80 percent of the marketers , surveyed that they are working with their peers , HR and to support the planning .
There are also looking to other industries to find new ways , although many things can happen .
Whoever progress is wrong . The report found most marketing is not taking enough steps to simplify and streamline .
For example , the majority of can not report that they do not yet have the basic ; publishing , they do not have the basic publishing , and structures in place to support the content of the content of the business .
It is a universal matter to certain things and provide personalized experiences .
It 's hard to ensure messages .
A central content repository to manage and control content quality , compliance .
It is difficult to understand that the sales and marketing technology supports the situation .
It is not possible to do this , but it is publishing of having sex and it is a challenge .
For every step , our address is To publish successfully at scale .
This begins with having the right , but platform platform create great content , but also extends .
Just to be clear , if you are small with a finite of content producing a small amount of content creators producing a small amount of content , you can probably get better .
You can create your own tools , such as company style , such as company style , and rely on free ones to help you distribute and distribute your content .
That is the tip .
But when you get to be a large , organization one with dozens or even hundreds of content to support your efforts , which is why you 'll need more sophisticated tools to support your efforts .
Yes , those tools are often expensive , but if you choose ones that truly provide value and that can help you become more streamlined and efficient , the costs will far exceed the costs .
It 's the second post in a series about why CMOs is the second post .
It Chain to highlight some of the key , findings , in a new report and findings .
The first post in this series was about why publishing has become it to the growth of every business .
It 's recent report about the recent report about the importance of publishing . It calls out the cost of today 's marketing challenges .
I believe this challenge are a number of related problems , such as managing , and effectiveness of content .
I can illustrate the average of these issues , the report shares a number of interesting proof contributors about the average business .
Do not have a content owner and an calendar in place to efficiently plan content plan .
I can not believe it is a big issue .
In fact , content is hard for salespeople .
I believe and believe managing is a challenge .
Believe it , Content fails to motivate , to drive cross-sell or to challenge .
Big assets do not support the buyer 's journey .
The report goes on to note that problems have , that have `` `` become major of sales and hurting the ability '' from their investments , because they are digital and solution to marketers .
In turn that means that marketers will need to find ways to optimize and complexity the quality and quality of modern sales .
There is no arguing with the fact that the content of the content is n't easy .
All the more , so when you are trying to do so for a global audience while also trying to reflects your company 's style , that is your company 's style , and brand standards .
Even though these are valuable tools , there are valuable news and valuable news that can help you .
Whether or not it is developing your content strategy , picking the right keywords for search for search for the right keywords , and analyzing .
In the key , it is being certain in your use of those tools and platforms .
Most of us have tight budgets to work within and that means making smart choices by identifying those tools .
It is not just about money .
It is about figuring figuring out which tools add real value to your operation by making it better , giving it a better end , or allowing you to achieve more .
The best tools do a combination of all three .
So while we acknowledge that there is growing pressure , thank you to managing , the upside is that available now .
I can not recall the post off of a presentation that is based on a presentation of a presentation and speaker Andrew . It has already been through online , virtual Andrew Davis .
Even though in November 2015 , the event is attracted to November 2015 ; the event is attracted to the world .
If you think about it , we marketers it .
We are constantly looking to get high and having a serious addiction to spikes .
You know what I mean .
All the time you publish a piece of content , what is the first thing you do ?
You jump into your understand tool to see how it performed , hoping that it has more traffic and created a bigger peak than your last piece of piece .
That is because every time we see a spike , we get a rush .
It is like a hit of adrenaline , and before you know it , we are taking screenshots in the office .
Not only that since we crave spikes so much that we usually do everything we can try to make them happen .
Usually that means promoting new pieces with little , if any , thought to the strategy behind it .
Unfortunately , a few days after most spikes crash usually crash .
When they do , we are left wondering how we are going to get the next spike and make sure it is even bigger than the last .
It is a classic cycle of addiction , and I am here to tell you that we have to break it .
Consider this who you are intervention .
In this post , I am going to challenge many of the traditional ideas that most of you have about how to distribute content .
Getting High is what We Can Learn from WestJet to recovery is to show you what addiction looks like .
Let us spend a minute talking about a Canadian airline about a Canadian airline for quite some time .
They are always chasing new highs .
If you look at their website , you will see that they have made hundreds of videos .
They have got April Fool 's videos and rap videos , Christmas videos , and flash mob videos .
Everything you can think of is to build their brand and connect with anything .
Some of their videos are excellent and have Led Zeppelin to amazing lifestyle .
Their 2013 is for example , has been viewed more than 40 million times .
It is pretty spectacular , right ?
The problem is , after each high is over , there is their traffic just over , there is rather back down to where it was rather than growing .
They are not building their community or brand brand , they are just creating periodic with their great videos .
I am positive we would all envy the success of some of those videos , but I do not think they are taking the right approach by peak to peak .
Change your Mindset for Longer-Lasting that Success and so many others are facing is n't a question .
It is a issue issue .
All too often , today 's content can use what I like everywhere .
In other words , they post their content anywhere and everywhere , everywhere , without stopping to consider if there may be a better way .
We spend so much time creating our content , and yet so little refining .
We need to make some changes .
Is all the number of spikes that we get really the name of the game ?
I do not think so .
If you want to be a great , marketer you should not be measuring your success by the height of your peaks .
I prefer to refer to the content marketing success .
You have to stop worrying about spikes and instead strive to elevate your problem .
In other words , you are goal should always be certain that you are next valley your last valley .
That is how you build an audience over time .
It is a More problem Approach to achieve Distribution .
It means that you should stop making noise and instead start building .
Once you do , you will find that you can get bigger , better results , even when you produce less content .
One company that has really mastered this is TripAdvisor .
They publish a lot of content . The most can be found Choice Awards . Where is their annual range ?
It is the best thing and it can be found on the idea of the best in the world if you have the idea .
I am currently reminded of e-mails on Choice Awards .
They post about it on social media .
They purchase advertisements of advertisements and write releases .
At first glance there may be a lot like poop strategy , but it 's not .
That is because building momentum has very little to do with where you distribute your content and everything to do with your content .
I believe that the key to key social momentum is to promote your content over time .
I enjoy thinking about it as following the social momentum curve , where you use one channel and then started to slow .
The chart explains this well .
The idea is that you begin with one-to-one with the folks in your email database .
Those are your followers who are part of your loyalty .
Once you grow , you can move on to social media , which is one-to-a-few .
After you grow , plateau and slow you then move on to paid promotion .
Finally , once you grow , it is possible and slow at the point of view .
This is a difficult thing to delivering over time .
In order to build momentum with the audience , the whole idea is to build further momentum with the next momentum with the next .
What this does is create social proof .
If you are not familiar with it , the psychological term for people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior for a given social situation .
In the online world , you are much more likely to consume and share content that is already possible .
When you build momentum with one channel before moving on to the next , you get a greater overall overall effect .
It is the Bottom Line Content Content content content .
It is time that we shift our attention to understanding how our content is .
I encourage you to spend less time thinking about where you distribute your content and thinking about when you distribute your content .
Stop pursuing many challenges and start building .
I believe for higher and higher , it is not an endless stream of higher and higher .
You will get better results , and wo n't have to create nearly as much content to do so .
That is a separate in my book .
I Content Connections is based off of a presentation that Val Swisher .
Even though in November 2015 , the event is attracted to November 2015 ; the event is attracted to the world .
I believe it is about making sure that your content is performing at the best .
At a time when content is more important than ever before , — is more important than ever before — .
That is because when you optimize your content , you can increase it and consistency on the quality associated with creating it .
Not only that , you can improve your mind .
That is true whether we are talking about marketing content , technical content , or both .
It is also true whether you are dealing with just a single source of single language or a source .
In my experience , there are four stages that companies go through as they become more experienced at content .
The four stages make the content optimization from the content to crawl , walk , and ultimately dance .
`` You 're crawling your content '' is not optimized .
It is possible that that does occur by way of tribal knowledge .
Everyone sort of knows the rules , and should any doubt arise , you will see people whispering , each weighing in on what the best course of action might be .
They may even do peer reviews of each other work from time to time .
The problem is that nothing is written down .
There is no problem information about what style and tone of voice , they should be using , what words are or acceptable .
As a result , all of that knowledge is not scalable .
For example , the quality and is can go down , which will only serve to confuse readers and degrade your brand .
In the process , you are likely to increase it and translation costs .
If you are into intelligent content , you will be able to find that you have not already done so . You are already certain .
It 's bad news all around because crawling just does n't work .
A walk out of the companies I work with .
When you are walking , you have gotten better because by now your styles and brand preferences are documented .
You have style and brand guidelines , and maybe even a list of the terms that you do and do n't use .
Since it is documented , all of this information is no longer available in a handful of people 's heads .
The problem is that since you are using it , it is since since you are using it tools , such as Word and Loving all of this information , which never do .
The hard truth is that no one ever reads or something because they do not have the time .
You have no way to enforce it .
As a result , when you reach the point where you are walking , you will soon discover that you are walking in circles .
You have invested time and money to get where you are , with people working to create your thoughts , but they never get used .
Since they rarely get updated , they are often outdated .
The bottom line is that despite time and money , you still effectively have the same problems you had when you were crawling .
I am keeping this .
When you are running , you are actually using powerful tools , which allow you to start enforcing .
You should use a tool that is creators and like a tool that is creators in a PDF that people have to pull a tool .
This allows you to easily enforce , terminology , and tone of voice preferences .
The great thing about running is that you can create content at scale because you can push all of these guidelines .
That is when you start it reaping .
You will have better , but it higher-quality .
You will decrease it , and it is costly .
You will ensure greater brand and not can occur .
Put another way , you will be able to do things better , cheaper , and faster , which is exactly what you should be .
The last step is dancing , which I like to think about as the missing piece of as the missing optimization in the content .
It is possible since it is only in the past few months that the technology has existed with our content possible .
What do I mean by dancing ?
It is when the terms and it can be found in your translation match .
Let me explain the situation .
Paying your content in lots of different languages usually have a database memory .
Every time you send a new piece of content to be translated , it 's checked against the database to see if any of the words are any individual words .
If there are any pulled out and reused and reused , considerably .
Think about it when you are dancing , you are marrying what has been translated , but what your content are doing .
It can be pulled from your translation with your writing memory if you send your new content to be translated .
To do this you need the right tools , including a database to database memory , your translation , and yet another system that does n't make sense .
In multiple languages that dancing content , dancing should be the end of content .
This way , not only is your English content , but also all of your mind .
Even maturity from the content of the content , it is more complex than Model .
Going from one to the next takes greater and greater , investments .
I understand , you 'll find that the results you get from doing so better content , faster time-to-market .
It is the first post in a series about why CMOs is the first post .
It Chain to highlight some of the key , findings , in a new report and findings .
Please learn more about the report and this series ; check out this foundational .
It is a matter of occurrence takeaways from it 's recent report .
We could not agree more .
Even though it turns out , many more than 360 marketing marketing is not able to research it .
In fact , 96 percent of them agreed that it is the quality and structure job to achieving their growth goals .
This is not true , more than the 60s percent noted that the `` 70 '' also noted that the `` Think of their marketing '' content can be found and supports core , social content , and supports core and supports .
That is a lot to take , but what it can all be worse if they succeed .
In the report , that is because it is Accelerates : growth sales and marketing programs .
I believe speed and agility by streamlining and agility and offerings .
I believe ROI on marketing technology ; sales , and earned , owned , and paid , investments .
I understand the time , however hassle , and complexity of managing .
I can content content content in personalized with personalized and engaging in personalized entertainment .
At Acrolinx , we would expand that last point to talk about the critical role that content has to play in building relationships .
You also build a connection with your main touchpoint , but it is what personifies with them , it 's what personifies and allows you to not build a connection with .
That makes publishing essential .
How Marketing Content Impacts , Impacts that the theme theme is that marketing marketing can positively positively be impact .
In fact , when marketing is asked how it can be , they cited this , they cited as well .
It seems as though greater sales can be tactics on greater sales and greater sales to communicating .
We agree , though we respectfully that there is a possibility to be taken here .
Beyond Marketing Content , but the Forbes report is focused on marketing content .
That includes content from other teams such as techdocs , product , and sales .
That is because all of this content lives online and is therefore therefore a few clicks from prospects and can not understand .
This is both good and bad news .
On the positive side , it means that they have access to a much greater supply of content to help them grow the business .
The challenge , however , is all of those efforts , while all of those efforts consistency .
It is the CMOs who pull it off by creating company-wide , publishing than simply ones who stand to reap .
Just so take note .
I believe it is essential .
We have long conversations about it , and are certain to have the support research to help us make that point .
Even though Officer at MarketingProfs is based on a presentation that gave Officer at MarketingProfs .
Even though in November 2015 , the event is attracted to November 2015 ; the event is attracted to the world .
I am a big fan of creating quality quality .
Sometimes I wonder if that is the odds at the odds with the basic need .
After all , no matter how good your content is , you usually need a lot of it to understand and fill your understand .
If you hit the gas on content creation , the quality usually takes a nosedive on content .
Does that mean quality and quantity are mutually exclusive ?
Of course not .
They can absolutely coexist .
And good content can scale the medication right .
I am talking about things like being bigger , braver , and bolder — .
Most people play it right now so they all help the biggest address right now .
At a time , when there is so much content and noise , playing it safe makes it really difficult to cut through and stand out .
High out is what you need to do .
That does not mean creating more content though , you will need a lot of it , but rather creating better content that people find engaging .
The means that striving to be bigger , braver , and bolder .
Let me explain the situation .
It is a bigger stories that usually have bigger impact .
To make yours bigger , you have to put your product or service into the lives of the people you are serving .
Remember , it is not about you , it is about what you do for others and why they should do business with you .
The most effective way to do this is to think about how you use your story to convert people to your tribe , so they become interested in you .
One company that has a lot of money .
I was familiar with their brand , but their brand about these California-based , they had produced an online course of coffee .
While I admit that I was pretty skeptical about taking an effort about something I am certain I knew how to do , I signed up .
As it turns out , I learned a lot and wound wound buying some of their coffee .
What Blue Bottle is doing with it , course is telling a bigger story by converting people into their tribe .
In my opinion , they are providing highly informative and valuable .
I am not talking about basic , but things can occur .
I mean really great content that I did n't know .
By teaching teaching people , why better coffee matters , it puts it in a bigger story , but we 're also part of something .
There are a lot of way to get to create stories then creating a Skillshare .
Take a chance , for example , which has been giving away , style for quite some time .
You can download it , edit it , and use it anyway .
It is because it is bigger of the world to make an e-mail less annoying .
I believe played , though .
Well , played .
I believe marketing to braver marketing is figuring out how to make people part of a tribe content .
I think the best way is to tell braver .
One company that does this really is matter .
In case you do n't know them , Slack is a team communication that replaces things such as project , management , and to a certain extent , even e-mail .
There is a few months back , they can launched podcast called `` The Slack '' .
If you have not used it yet , it is about making work a like a king or a similar podcast .
It 's bold and fun , kind of like `` This American Life '' meets `` The Office , '' which is bold and brave .
I also like the podcast , what we can learn from , and steal two great ideas .
The first is the important thing to understand over time .
It has taken an internal feedback to the podcast , and changing it based on both the producers .
They mean they 're constantly the show .
The other great idea you should take from them is that they produce two versions of every show .
One is a half-hour version that gives the full program while the other is a series of shorter segments .
This is really smart because the shorter version is much better suited for those who do not have time to listen to the full program .
Be brave and try new things .
You may be pleasantly surprised with the results .
Becoming bolder with writing and tone for a minute what would happen if you were to strip away all of the visuals .
I 'm not sure gone .
Images is gone .
Color of gone .
If all that you were left with was your content , would others still be able to recognize your brand ?
Would you ?
I believe that for really great brands , the answer is yes .
They use a bold tone of voice that 's instantly instantly , engage their audience , but also differentiate from their audience .
It really pays off .
Your tone of voice is about who you are and what you 're like to deal with .
It is your fault in many ways , but it is your customers .
Not only that , your tone of voice is your culture .
It matches your story .
It can communicates empathy with people you are trying to reach .
Would you like some examples ?
Listen to the websites , like companies such as M+R and Shorts .
Both of them have a very difficult tone of voice that they use to attract like-minded .
It really works .
I believe Quantity does n't have to be your first objective .
The key is to make sure that you have the nerve right .
That story is telling you that you are inviting people to be part of your tribe and is memorable .
It is all about being big , brave , and bold .
If you can afford that combination , you will find that you can create amazing content whether at scale or not .
Our mission is very simple .
We want to help you create content that is both on brand and on Target .
To be on brand brand , your content has to use the right words and phrases to accurately reflect your organization .
I would like to be on target , that content has to be for your specific audience .
This is the way we achieve this is by providing providing our customers and governance .
If you have used it before , you know that the guidance comes better .
It is the part part is the framework we provide so that you can do this at scale .
Behind all of this is an advanced . It is analytics that we have developed after more than 300 man-years .
The following things can be found in 30 leading content in tools , grammar , and tone of voice , grammar , and tone of voice .
Building on all of this , we have got some pretty exciting plans for the year ahead .
I believe Abound got a number of great , enhancements to make Acrolinx to make Acrolinx more powerful and dynamic .
These include changes to our engine , guidance , and other things .
We can improve our thoughts , analytics audience-based checking .
It is possible to make your target audience for setting up your understand .
I can not only understand your user administration , but make it easier to focus on your target audience .
Driving content consistency and reuse .
It is in any problem , content content is created in a highly normal fragmented , both internally and agencies .
I 2016 , we will be improving our guidance to make it easier to create it no matter where in or outside of your organization .
It 's hard to believe and language of voice support .
I Swedish currently currently supports six languages , English , French , Swedish , and Japanese .
It can be building out our support for a Chinese and adding Spanish to the mix .
It 's enhancing to be enhancing from our voice guidance , but in German and the other languages we support .
We will improve the guidance , and make it more difficult .
It is more fun to use the way to use it by making it friendly by making it friendly .
I am certain that targeted for specific audiences .
At this time , it can be able to provide greater guidance on the tone of voice , of voice , and formality , and formality of your content .
I believe insights can happen .
There are lots of content to give content in the content of content creators in their favorite research .
We will improve the things we offer by `` Using scoring '' as a leading indicator of impact .
We believe that our problem can be a leading indicator of how you can perform in the market .
I 2016 we will be announcing to connect Acrolinx to enterprise .
I believe for business intelligence and can not recall .
We know content , it can be complex .
I 2016 we will be rolling out deeper integrations with several of the leading marketing cloud platforms .
We are very excited about what we have planned for 2016 and look forward to they are ready .
Stay tuned for updates and , as well , thank you for what we are doing .
I recently gave the post off of based on a presentation that Steve President is based on the presentation of a presentation , but I believe it is not sufficient .
Even though in November 2015 , the event is attracted to November 2015 ; the event is attracted to the world .
I believe one of the largest content marketing marketing is rare in the world .
To give you a sense of how big it is , consider that we 've got thousands of products and solutions with content with content .
We create our content in nearly 100 different languages .
I believe a content marketing program at that scale is a large challenge .
Doing so in a way that we are consistently speaking with one voice is even harder .
The key to managing is having an effective strategy .
At IBM , our strategy consists of five parts . One is Personalization . Is about getting as close to our customers .
In other words , we know that if you are a database administrator in shame administrator , you will be looking for content in London or New York .
Our goal is to make sure the experience we create for our end users is always for their specific needs and experience .
Just speaking , that means not only having a clear overview of different content , we have at our disposal , videos , etc .
I also know knowing how that can specific end users .
We need to do that , we need to learn as much as we can about our own , and including what they 're focused on , and what search for themselves , and what search for themselves .
All of that information gets into it , we then use to help personalize .
I believe we have about 130 different opinions at any given time .
They are constantly evolving as we refine our understanding of our target audience .
The key to creating really useful , can not be sure that they actually inform how we create our content .
We have a variety of touch points with our customers and marketing activities . This allows us to gather that data .
I am talking about everything from the language that they speak and the geographic of geographic , and where in the buying process they currently are .
It is the key to making really rich to knowing that you are segmenting correctly .
It is also possible for giving our content creators about how they should be writing to best engage a particular particular audience .
Believe it , Path Prospects Prospects Prospects are always on a journey down the path to purchase .
We have the right content for every step to help us further .
In order to do this , we must not only know who our individual is , but also what their individual is , but how they go from recognizing to making a certain decision .
Think the right content at the right points in time is an ongoing process .
At IBM , the way that we approach this is by mapping .
We used to use a rules-based engine to deliver the appropriate content content .
It is difficult to understand the unique needs to meet the unique and unique needs of our customers .
To do this , we have created an approach that we call content as a service , repositories , we pull it together to meet particular criteria , format it .
It 's a sophisticated process , but one that has us allowed us to gain tremendous content quickly .
It 's five , but not least is performance .
Our decision is to always deliver a customer experience .
Believe it , that happens , we embed our activities and take care of our activities .
This allows us to identify opportunities so we can improve our content .
We have learned , for example , the more we personalize our content the more engagement we get .
With the right personalization with the right , personalization we have consistently been able to double our engagement , which in turn drive drive .
In addition , it has been important to have a clear understanding of what success looks like , to have the ability to roll those into a dashboard that we can have the ability to roll in a dashboard that we can share .
Our bread is our bread and butter .
They are what we use on a regular basis to demonstrate the value we are providing , so they are truly providing .
You have it .
I believe it is possible to call , but it can happen , process , process , process process , and performance — .
It is possible to apply the size of a highly successful content program marketing .
It is everywhere that you look these days . There 's a new , but telling you how the race for the White House is heating .
Between the name , calling and the grandstanding , it almost seems like a reality TV show playing out before our eyes .
At Acrolinx , we are not in the business of being political and do not intend to start .
Being the language of geeks that we are , we could not resist the opportunity to offer a unique perspective .
It started , as most things do . When one of us asked a simple question , what anything , can we learn about their official campaign websites ?
To be clear , we are not talking about the ideas of their ideas or practicalities .
You can judge things for yourself .
What we are interested in is the quality of their content .
Try to use a portal for themselves to the world , their website , because they are all important .
And while we understand that the content has not authored the content themselves , they are used and how well it 's written who they are .
We pointed our linguistic at the official five , official websites , and tedcruz.org .
I 2,200 that we analyzed more than 954,000 pages .
For our own general information you can or may not have known .
No matter what your political views may be , these five takeaways on the candidates .
1 . Trump and Trump . Keep More to say Than More , but the two may be the current front-runners .
At 255,962 is loaded up with far more content than any of his content .
More than double the amount of content on Cruz 's site and nearly so relative to Rubio 's website .
In the meantime , with a whopping , Clinton has the most to say of all .
To put that into perspective , her website contains more words than the first three Harry Potter books .
Whether and whether Cruz and Rubio are more passionate and Rubio , and whether Cruz and Rubio are succinct .
For his part , Sanders seems to have taken the middle ground , not wanting to say too much or too much .
Perhaps words are correct ?
In the House , there is not any Content in the House , but Rubio Comes Closest .
It is not politically politically motivated , it is simply the truth .
We score content using a 100-point scale , where the higher the quality is the better of the content .
When our software can content quality quality , it is specifically looking for grammar , spelling , and terminology usage .
The more issues it can , the lower the lower the overall earns the content earns .
If you want to know all of the geeky details , you can find them here .
I believe a good score is subjective . In our experience , 80 's experience is in our experience for good content .
As you can see , when we scored the candidates .
With said that , if content quality is any indication of strength , then then Rubio is the best man for the job .
He has the highest regard between the highest level of 8 and therefore the highest quality content .
He has far far less content than some of his nature , which could explain why .
After all , consistently creating great content at scale to help you .
Almost 3 years old can choose Spanish Language , Content Language Given that there are more than 41 language content on their sites .
In the instance , Cruz , and Sanders are all trying to appeal to this ; I believe that the sites are bilingual .
Trump and Rubio 's sites do not .
Rubio does have a couple of Spanish language pages , but not many and they are not easy .
Maybe he does not care about these voters , at least not enough to target them with content in their native language .
Maybe they just need some tips on how to pick the right , localization .
No worries , we have got you covered guys . This post is for you .
Trump and Rubio have the most hard Readable and Lively with the story quality .
I believe also scores around a variety of other things , even scores around a variety of other things .
These are two unsure of writing that make content more engaging and enjoyable to read .
They are among the things that differentiate between good writing .
One single person enough , here too Rubio sweeps with the best overall scores , followed by Trump .
Their content is the easiest to read and arguably .
It is a good thing to do a content that has the worst performing content across the content of his music .
Yes , he could have been writing that way , but why would you ?
Meanwhile , Clinton and Sanders are middle of the pack .
It is 5 ) Sanders and Cruz , have the most Formal Formal speaks to writing in a way matters .
If you are too formal , risk , sounding like a comfort institution .
If you are too suppose , you can also alienate your audience .
We see that Rubio and Trump have the most simple content while Sanders and Cruz 's content is the most formal .
It is not the sort of gentlemen . You may want to loosen up a bit !
Who are you going to choose ?
If the race for the White House were decided on Marco Rubio , we would have a clear winner in Marco Rubio .
He has the best content overall , even if there is not very much to his nature to his nature .
I believe in the real world from the real world that there is a real post from another post for another website .
If you weigh more over the course of this election , remember to be critical of the details .
The quality of a little bit is a website content , but it could seem trivial , but it could be an early indication or warning with his attention .
May the best man , or a woman .
There are data privacy on the news privacy in the news these days .
I have given the amount of scrutiny to what you are doing and given your data to what you are doing and clarity and comes to what you 're doing with their data .
However , the majority of us never take the time to read privacy , therefore , most of us never read privacy .
Because we often accept them and move on , you may assume how well they are , they may really not matter .
People can become sensitive to data privacy that may change .
If it does , chances are that most people will be disappointed with what they find .
That is because privacy sometimes are often dense , full of can make sense , and incredibly difficult to make sense of , though .
In an August 2015 , the study of study , time study , the female privacy , TIME , and Uber . It can happen , and Twitter , Twitter .
I optimization of the part of the effort , but it is a panel by judges while running it through Acrolinx .
In the second point , the goal was to evaluate each company 's situation in terms of language , and readers readers that language is already used .
It 's the included of the included . It 's in the case of plain language , guidelines , the average number of issues identified per sentence 's words .
All of these factors play an important role in determining how easy a piece of content is , or is n't to understand .
As it turns out , the results of the study , it is considerably different .
Who Came Out on the planet ?
The answer is one .
You should google 2 .
I believe three .
I believe it is four .
Apple five .
`` Uber 6 '' by 6 .
I am not sure 7 .
I believe it was clear results in some clear results .
In a way that allows to have done a `` best job and Facebook for having done a `` `` `` `` `` good job '' privacy and make decisions of the decisions that allows you to understand and make decisions .
In the meantime , you should put on the middle of the pack , Uber , and Apple wound up in the middle of the pack .
I 'm not sure , which was both called the right job and Lyft on communicating in their opinions .
They can have a long sentences , poor sentences , and a style that can not occur .
No matter what your reason is , you should Care No matter what your view is and to be honest , most of us have n't spent a lot of time formulating opinions about the reason we think .
I believe that take the time to create the time to create the time to understand always get a better result with their target audience .
That is true whether we are talking about privacy ; it is a technical component , a temporary copy , or a lot of content that you create .
You should always take the time to ensure that your content is similar .
If you do not understand it , you will get better results with it .
What would you like to learn more about this study ?

Next week we are off to sunny Las Vegas .
You might think we are going to play the `` slots '' or to take in a couple of shows , ICC .
If you are not familiar with the do , it is the only conference .
Things such as scaling such , scaling , your content , technologies and reusing .
In the worst website , the goal of the goal is to help marketers , the goal of the three-day copy and single-source .
Do you tell me what you say ?
The site goes on to explain whether or not you are still content for each individual channel .
It is more important to you , you are locking in silos from those who need it .
You are making it nearly impossible for those who want it to use it , to use it to share it with others .
That is a big mistake .
It only prevents you from reaching new audiences , but it also prevents you from becoming the lean , mean machine , content-producing .
This is a real situation .
This may be all about being smarter with your content — , and following the lead of companies and the lead of pioneering .
They and other people have been real when it comes to creating content that is more intelligent and agile .
It is not only valuable , but it is not only valuable , but also made , acquire , acquire , and engage in a fashion audience .
We are proud to be a part of this event both as a sponsor and by having our own own Dr. Andrew Bredenkamp .
His session , titled `` The Best Tools for Multi-Channel '' for Multi-Channel , will be held next Tuesday .
If you are interested in checking it out , here is a brief description , here 's a brief description , are most commonly driven more content , with less effort and expense .
I understand that publishing of intelligent content strategy strategy is what fruit of intelligent content .
However , as organizations and intelligent content becomes the norm , capabilities .
It can happen in the top issues , considering considering a move considering considering a move to intelligent content .
Do not discuss four of the biggest challenges at this time , but suggest practical ways of overcoming them .
A great alert is that these big challenges are consumer and consistency , and velocity personalized content .
If you are lucky enough to be in Vegas next week , stop by and check by Andrew 's panel .
In the rest of you , we will be sharing the highlights from that discussion in a future blog post .
It is best to stay tuned .
We are excited to Launch the latest edition of the Global Content . Excuse me , Index .
For this new report , we decided to mix things up .
Some different industries would be like a like a king and a like a king .
Because the industry is adopting content content to help it overcome one of its greatest challenges , it is pretty uncertain .
Of course , to be successful at content marketing , but it is not necessary to create content on a consistent basis .
We wanted to know if they were up to the task and decided to find out .
In order to do so , we pointed our thoughts at the website of 47 different companies .
We are talking about companies that make everything from cars and car parts to healthcare , and chemicals .
The companies all have in common is that large , global operations , and more in $ revenue .
Many , like Toyota , you can Bosch , are also household names .
We analyzed the individual web pages of our research .
It is more than half a million sentences and just over 4.2 .
This content across the highlights of what we learned about the manufacturing industry 's learned about manufacturing industry is the most content and the quality varies in the beginning .
To put that in perspective , we think of a score of 72.0 .
I believe that while some companies are creating a wide range of scores , it is clear that some companies are creating great content .
The list industry industry earned an average content impact on 70.1 .
I am in 66.9 , and construction and construction about example .
I can do some of the other industries we have studied , manufacturing is performing at the middle of the pack .
While on average it is publishing higher than say the retail , aerospace and defense , and insurance and mining industries .
It is highly likely highly of their individual companies in our experience , including companies in their blog information , rather than in their blog information , rather , in their product information .
The manufacturing industry is unnecessary .
At the following point of the companies we have looked at had inconsistent quality across their best and the worst content between their best and the worst content .
Take it from us , that is a problem .
When the quality of your content is inconsistent , it can confuse what can confuse you .
As telling the report of the report , findings is just one company consistently across website .
I believe one in five companies not only had any idea , but also one in five companies inconsistency .
We are talking about a variance of 15 points or more between their best and the worst content .
Not only that , the average content variance across industry industry , one of the highest of we 've studied .
Where to from here ?
The manufacturing industry has issues with it , but it comes to mind right , many of the quality and their content .
My latest report gives the blow-by-blow of how the industry is stacking .
To find out more , download the full report .
This week was the dream of my life .
Well , my good friends at Acrolinx at Acrolinx , they 're sponsoring .
As soon as I heard the words , I assumed they meant it , a guess or some other industry event .
Okay , I thought , mustering , mustering .
As it turns out , they were actually inviting me to The Houston , Livestock and Rodeo .
Come on .
I know I 'm the Content . It 's all , but I 'm not the only one who sees the fun in bringing cowboys and content together .
Am I able to understand a situation ?
All right , so perhaps you are not as excited as I was .
Fine , though I do not know why .
After all , writing has a lot more to do with killing riding than you probably would have guessed .
Let me explain what I mean .
It is a lot harder than it looks .
As a sitting in the stands , it is easy to think that riding a bull is a pretty straightforward straightforward situation .
You get on and you do not let go .
In reality , it is a different story .
It takes experience , timing , and physical stamina to ride the buck , although it is without getting thrown off .
I believe amazing content is no different .
Yes , everyone thinks they are a great writer , but that is not true .
Love the right words to understand complex ideas in a way that is easy to understand is really hard .
The more , as long as you have to be concerned about things like adopting the right style and tone of voice to make your content engaging .
It is so hats to all the bull riders and writers .
They deserve the consequences .
You have to have the right equipment .
When you think about a rodeo , you probably imagine a cowboy .
One wearing boots with spurs who is got a lasso in his hand , and depending on the event .
These are not the sort of elaborate , as they all help the cowboy do his job .
The boots offer protection , the spurs help him maintain his balance , and lasso , is how he captures the balance .
Believe that , writers use tools as it is accurate and on brand brand .
In small , those tools might include a dictionary and thesaurus .
I believe where there are enough writers creating content across departments , offices , and geographies .
I want to create great content at scale to create great content at scale big companies generally need a content and consistency .
You are already experiencing skills .
The job of Cowboys lasso , writers , writers have the harder job .
In both case , it is all about trying to take something that is wild or trying to take something that is wild .
I have never gone to head with a bull , but I know from how hard it is to lasso with the right words to create content .
As with any skill , it is a matter of practice .
As with bull riding , it helps to never show any fear .
It may shine , but it 's a team sport .
I like the rodeo 's version of the show , at the rodeo .
They could not do their job if it were not for all of the people who support them .
The rodeo clown is just one example .
You may think of them as simply providing comic relief , they are providing comic relief from the bull .
There would be a lot more than cowboys .
It is the same with writing .
We tend to think of it as a job for one where the author gets all of the glory .
There are often people behind the content that are good .
From writers and editors , to subject experts and graphic designers , it takes a small army to produce a small army .
It is all about your score .
To win an event , you need to earn the highest score .
There are typically between two and four judges who score both the cowboys and the animals are able to awarding them each and 25 points .
The result is a score that can range from a low of four points to a high quality .
Since both 59 and animals can have an off night , a low score can have an off night re-ride .
To ensure the quality of your writing scoring , content scoring is as important .
It 's a great indication of whether or not your content is written enough to meet its content .
According to Acrolinx , any piece of content that earns a content impact of less than less than 70 's .
In fact , content with scores below that should trigger a certain option .
There are Five truths about content coming to you live from The Houston , Livestock and Rodeo .
I hope it has inspired you to dust off your cowboy boots , fire up your laptop , and get busy creating great content .
Am I able to understand that ?
It is hard to believe that it has been 12 years since we launched in 2004 .
At that time , we had just recently recently from the German Research Center for Artificial and our powerful linguistic .
Unfortunately , we were also rocking some pretty bad bad , in that case .
Check out this fantastic photo to see for yourself .
Fast forward to 2016 , and so much has changed .
We are a company with offices in the United States , Europe and Asia .
Over the years we have worked with hundreds of companies around the world , helping them create better content and speak with one voice .
While our mission remains , our mission certainly has not .
We have made countless minds , and it can occur to our software since then to create the best possible outcome .
We have updated our company , but today we are thrilled to unveil about our company .
Our new identity is more than just a pretty face .
Our New dances represents our vision for the future .
For example , the fresh , typeface in our new logo our love of beautiful writing , while we associate with one voice .
Since you are already reading this post , why not take a moment to look around our newly revamped ?
It has a much more modern look , it is still our repository written for you .
Our suspicion and a blog posts are needed to giving you the best ideas .
You should stay tuned for some great new research that is definitively proves the link between the content and business results .
We will be it very soon .
The past 12 years have been amazing .
We have been humbled by how our technology has been adopted , and by you — , and friends — .
Thank you for taking a moment to celebrate with us . We look forward to many more years of working together .
I am in San Francisco on San Francisco for the annual , but some of us at San Francisco at the annual price .
It is a great event and if you have not checked it out before you definitely should .
While we were pleasantly surprised to find out that we had won a Stackie , an award given to companies technology .
I Uberflip Digital , PitchBook alongside Connective , and Uberflip .
To be considered for the award , companies have to submit a single slide stack .
You can see what we submitted together here .
The purpose of the awards is to encourage companies to marketing their approach to marketing marketing .
While it sounds like we are trying to toot our own horn here , the reality is that I 'm telling you about this because I think the award is really important .
The fact of the matter is that there are currently companies in the world , you can see them all in this marketing marketing .
It 's exciting for your average marketing to know which ones are exciting and which are n't impossible to choose from .
We think that the Stackie Stackie the Stackie by helping to cast a light on how others are thinking about their stack .
There is so much confusion in the mind space .
The fact is that back in 2012 when Gartner would CMOs would soon spend more on it . Do , they were right .
That day has arrived and modern marketing marketing are overwhelmed by all of the technology choices .
It 's the little guy in the blue Technology .
We did so because we wanted to convey our stack .
After all , you guys are the real in our way .
As you might expect , our Stackie is heavily heavily focused on technology , such as our own .
We are not shy about the fact that Acrolinx is a critical part of our California .
That is because content is critical to the success of your business and to do it , your content has to be great .
That means that it has to be on-brand and have a voice that is uniquely .
This is exactly what we offer with our brain .
Thank you .
We were very excited and honored to win this award . This is a very surprising represents for what I am saying . We are even more excited about the award .
Even though it making technology choices , it showcases of remaining focused on your customers and making technology .
If you would like to learn more about our Stackie , talk or about where Acrolinx can fit into your stomach stack .
I recently had the opportunity to participate in a manner discussion at the intelligent discussion at Las Vegas this month .
I CEO and CEO on the panel were several diverse content experts , Josh Manton .
I believe it was Tim Walters , the Co-Founder , and Principal Analyst .
As a group , we discussed intelligent content from various shapes , including angles , including angles and consistency .
I have summarized the key in the session , however , I can not recall at the session .
I framework that a business imperative is a business imperative of a business content .
That is because it is essential to ensure all of your company 's content — .
If it is not , but you are going to be in big trouble .
I believe it is critical .
It can interact with a brand in many different ways to interact with a brand in different places .
If your content and messaging are not consistent from one touch , you can question your brand authority .
It is possible that you are a trusted authority like it is .
If their brands are lose control of the conversations , they are increasingly forced to show their trusted .
They need to act the part , which is what is driving the need for consistency .
I think that every piece of content is an opportunity to add or subtract .
If your content is not working hard for you by by accurately by accurately , and consistently representing your brand voice , it can do more harm than good .
That is why it is so important to pay attention to the quality of your content .
More companies are outlawed .
Even though , impersonal corporate speak has fallen out of favor .
Currently , there is no reason to be treated as genuine .
In order to make sure that they are using a conversational tone , companies need to make sure they are using a conversational tone .
I believe scale scale scale scale takes more than project to understand tools and can understand .
It aligns with your strategy in place that focuses you on the right , themes , and then a structure that aligns at your strategy .
The key is to make sure that you are as simple as possible , and then iterating upon it until you get it right .
Your content should be flexible .
I can come from and get used with many different people in the past .
That means you need to create your content with various potential and storing it .
To do this , you need to have the right , anyway and processes in place .
It is not about producing more content .
It is about producing better content in smarter ways .
For example , you might use Agile and wind up , but I can publishing less .
Thanks to those practices , the content might be more accurate and customer-centric .
You can not measure content of content ROI in weeks or months .
Remember , content marketing is a marathon and not a model .
You measure results in years , which means that you have to have a real vision for the long haul .
It is possible marketing to have everyone in your mind involved .
To make that possible , you have to get buy-in by communicating communicating .
When it becomes a difficult priority , it will be easier to get everyone on board and aligned .
It can be the key to personalization .
They are useful ways of just people by interests , needs , and desires .
Doing so then allows you to think about how to engage those specific groups , and what stories you need to use and keep their attention .
I hope these things are useful .
It was certainly a very interesting and you can not speak , one that I was honored to be a part of .
If it is not already on your list , make sure to keep an eye out for details about next year .
April Fools Day is the one day when you are allowed to play tricks on people and make them feel foolish .
You do not have to have your bed short , sheeted or fall for someone 's tall tale to be an April Fool .
Being careful is not taking the time to carefully carefully .
Basically , in 1992 , in some cases , such as Dan Quayle 's infamous `` potatoe . '' It was not a question of sloppiness .
In other words , such as Ray , cover of the Tails magazine , it was a practical joke .
It was a fake copy of the cover was created by some pretty important .
The result was a difficult occurrence . You ought to read the spelling of Ray and her family .
It is not surprisingly surprisingly , with such a fascinating cover went viral .
Sometimes typos is often good for a laugh , sometimes they are not only embarrassing .
The fact that in one of our job in our job lost his job over one fairly big mistake .
Take a break from working for a minute , check out these 13 examples , and see if you can find them all .
They are pretty easy to spot , a couple might take you a little longer .
If you get stuck , we have included a key with the answers at the very bottom of this post .
Happy , reeding .
First , this typo hits you right in the face .
I hope that you have a napkin .
I feel like Stella Artois is not so perfect after all .
This sign goes to demonstrate why it is important .
The answer is no , but apparently whoever created this sign does .
This functions in New York does not instill in the city 's educational system .
6-packs makes us question just how good their software is .
In the United States of course , the Romney campaign had an app that allowed you to apply an overlay .
This one was our favorite .
The program contains 8 program contains an embarrassing error .
Unfortunately , the school sent out to offer the school sent .
The government is not immune to typos .
This training guide was circulated to staffers in 2012 .
In addition , TV is no exception either .
It looks like it will be a hot week !
It is a typo . I am in a certain position million of these coins .
It is not surprisingly surprisingly , the mistake cost the director of the director of his job .
It 's old , Tattoo .
The only thing that is worse than losing your job over a typo is having one on your arm for the rest of your life .
So on this April Fools Day , we encourage you to take an extra look at your content , show some appreciation , and always make sure your content is correct .
It sounds too much trouble .
Why did you not say so ?
It can help , at this time .
I Nohing Key , but the answer should be 3 . It 's 3 . Do n't be preface , there should be America ' Eggregious .
It 's a variety of topics , we can surveyed about more than 600 professionals .
The bands we surveyed were writers and editors .
Our goal was to gain some thought into how these content people see the world .
Because there is no single definition of what is great , we decided to start a sense of what they think matters most .
We asked them to name the three factors that they view as most importantly when it comes to creating great content .
Here is what they said , What we found particularly interesting is the second most common response .
The only more commonly can cited was ensuring your audience , which makes sense .
The best written content in the world is n't worth much information .
I also focused on quality top responses on the quality of writing from different types of writing and different angles , can be certain to as well .
The quality of your writing clearly is not the only factor when it comes to creating great content , what is that writing is perceived to creating great content ?
It is not exactly a shocking thing , but wait , there is more .
In general , we both wanted to measure how confident our company is in the chart of the chart into the chart of their writing .
A lot of confidence are confident in the quality of their writing overall .
What is interesting about this to us , however , is that it flies in the face of some other research we did last year ?
When we published our biography Content in 2015 to Impact , we found that 69 percent of the quality of it writing .
By the way to this , it is n't a different group entirely , if the majority of the world 's top global brands are n't very good .
You have to wonder whether these professionals or not these writing quality are writing .
This is more supporting that theory .
We wanted to know what these professionals are to ensure the quality of their content .
The answer is that the two of them are 56 .
That is because they are either only reviewing some of their content prior to writers , or they just do n't have a process in place to improve their writers or improve their content .
In our view , there is a real disconnect here between perceived content and the companies actually meets the mark .
That is a problem because content quality matters .
In fact , it can have an issue on business results .
That 's a topic that we will be in later this month in a brand new report that we are creating about content quality .
You should stay tuned for all of the things .
To add some meaningful research to add their business , this report is going to be difficult .
Provide Albert Einstein once said that is the most difficult thing to understand .
Amen is my favorite .
The irony of the April 18 deadline will be the irony of tax .
If one of the brightest minds the world has ever known , what are the rest of us supposed to make of it ?
Perhaps doing your taxes ? Does n't you have an accountant or use one of the online services such as TurboTax .
We do not blame you if you do , but if that is the case , then you may not appreciate how the tax code is .
Sure , we all know that it is supposed to be hard to follow , but what you might not understand is that it is not what the tax code says .
Believe it in the proceedings , a prime example : in case provided , a prime example : `` In case provided in section or a court shall give notice of notice '' - and notice of the court manner .
We wish we could tell you what this monster of a sentence means , and at 97 words it truly is a formidable .
The writing is so convoluted and it just does n't make any sense .
And unfortunately unfortunately gems like this are not the exception , they are the rule .
We know because we recently used our minds tax code .
Before we get into the situation , you must be bristling .
We should acknowledge two things . This may be what we have ever done .
If you would like to invite us to your next cocktail party , just say the word .
There is a limit of how much even we were willing to geek out on this … , which translates into 2,917,684 .
Now that we 've got that off our chest , let 's move on to what we learned .
The details are below , but the juicy details can be summed up like this : `` If the IRS were in school , it would be flunking . ''
It is a big time .
It is not that the code is clearly with reference , but there is some of that .
The actual issue is that it is virtually unreadable .
It is too average to Albert Einstein , and more importantly .
We know this because readability was one of the dimensions code — and liveliness .
It is the factors that we can use to help differentiate from average content .
It clocked in high expectations for the content to be lively .
Use the website enough . It is the tax code after all .
This is inherently dull .
We at least hoped the content would score well in terms of can .
In retrospect , we based this ; assumption on the fact that , since the introduction of the Plain Writing acts Act of 2010 , the quality of the content has occurred .
The Act basically says that all of the government 's public-facing needs to be written so that it is understandable .
The number of government is departments to be making good progress .
You can see the most recent report card created by the female for Plain Language .
In the IRS seem to have missed the boat entirely .
They are either as daunted as anyone would be by the prospect of gobbledygook .
On Pro , it would be an easier task if they boiled all of that content into a more manageable .
The fact is that the fact that the tax code we analyzed had an average readability of 54 .
I know that there is a possibility that we can put things into perspective , in any case , we can put things into perspective , in a variety of top brands in the world , look at similar issues .
If we compare all 340 340 to what the IRS has managed with the tax code ?
The bottom line is that even if you have got a refund , doing your taxes is a drag .
The IRS has not helped matters by creating a tax code that 's virtually virtually .
We suggest using some of this year 's tax revenue to hire an army of editors .
I believe it is no laughing .
OK , at least not until you start laughing content .
We are taking a break from serious content to try to tickle your funny .
We have it up some of our favorite , but it content-related and cartoons in this post to help your day .
You may roll your eyes at some of them , but hopefully you may roll your eyes at some of them .
Without further being , let the laughfest begin .
What is the person writing rule that you should always remember ?
The double negatives are a no .
What should you invite to a fancy tea party ?
It is a proper problem .
What is a pirate 's favorite piece of content ?
I am uncertain .
The past , the present walked into a bar .
It was probably tense .
It was a while to his English class one day .
He said , `` A double negative forms a positive . ''
In some languages , such as a double negative is still a negative .
There is no language , but a double positive positive can form a negative .
I am referring to a voice from the back of the room .
6 . The numbers : The following : The following : The following : The following : The following : The following : The following : The numbers , and the numbers 11 . The numbers 11 . The numbers are , and the numbers 11 . The numbers are 6 .
Did you laugh out of some of them ?
If you have a better content joke or cartoon or just drop us a line — , drop us a line — .
Have a great day !
Currently , financial income is the key to the content of content .
They are constantly trying to work out how to create engaging in engaging in engaging in engaging in sexual activity , but what the best ways are to distribute it to their target audiences .
First of course , it is to communicate key messages to prospects and can not shepherd .
As important as this work , it is worth remembering . It is worth remembering that creating great content can serve a much higher cause for yourself .
In some cases , it can be used to help people in need .
In fact , it can even save lives .
I know first-hand called having been involved with a great , organization called Without Borders .
This focus on health is to increase access to knowledge by choosing by the artists linking translators and education .
One of the reasons why I was involved with Translators with Translators and creating effective content is n't a problem .
It is something that can really make a difference to everyone .
Let me give you an example .
You probably remember the horrific earthquake that was on April 25 , 2015 .
It left but people dead , but 23,000 and hundreds of thousands homeless .
It was devastation in the region for many years to come .
It was within minutes of the initial quake .
I believe those responses were calls for help .
The challenge is that like the Tweet , they were n't in English and therefore they were n't widely understood .
The majority of us would have no idea what the purpose above is trying to express .
Is it a warning or a crying for help ?
Is it request for something particular or a critical piece of information ?
What can help Borders try to address people language that make it difficult to help people otherwise ?
Every year they translate more than two million words for NGOs in crisis .
From a few hours of the earthquake , we had built a rapid response team that consisted of Nepali , Nawari .
We put together a list of common words and phrases needed in crisis .
We fed the list to partner to start it , but monitoring monitoring monitoring messages coming out of Nepal .
Over the days , weeks , and months months , we translated a lot of communication , and bringing it to groups working in very different languages .
It was difficult to crisis that experience and many others . We learned three lessons that apply just as many lessons as they do .
They are always understand who your target audience is .
In the case of Nepal , this was essential because 22 different languages are spoken there .
In the regional of regional languages , we were able to work out in regional regional , as we were able to work out that Nepali , and Hindu were the most important languages to focus on .
Always measure what you are doing .
In content marketing , people are always saying how important it is to measure the impact that you are having .
It has been a different experience for us .
In fact , we have had great success showing how important having content in the right language can be .
In the recent study , we did showed that after reading content in English about the content correctly .
When we put that content into it , one of the local languages , they got tired of the questions .
That is a large difference .
You should create content that is right for your target audience .
One of the projects we have seen at Translators is creating simplified articles on health issues .
There are not articles articles with all of the detail that a medical professional would need .
Some information can be like a king which is easy to understand .
To check you to remember these lessons , I would encourage you to check to check these lessons in your own content .
It is a fantastic thing , but it is a fantastic organization and one that needs to continue is important .
If you are involved in creating content for your company , chances are that you are under a lot of pressure .
That is because there is an insatiable appetite for content these days .
As a result , many companies feel like they are under the gun to produce as much as they can .
And while many people understand that the ultimate goal should be to create better content , not just more of it , you can find why quality should always make decisions quantity .
That is why I am excited to share some of the latest research .
In a new report , we are calling , Good ! What to Double the Impact of Your Content , findings ?
Our data of based on the results can be found at the results of a results in common professionals .
We asked them for their opinions about how confident they are in their content .
The short version of the results can be summed up like this , but we have proof .
According to our writing , when you take the time to focus on the quality of your content — and the style of your voice can have dramatic results .
In fact , according to our findings , it is the quality of your content can lead to a : increase in brand perception .
In the way , increase in it .
In order to purchase it for intent then increase .
That is a pretty big pay for just stopping to take the time to make sure you content your content is really well written .
And for marketers , it helps make the business case for why you should either be creating less content so you can help !
If you are interested in getting it proof that content quality quality does matter , then I strongly encourage you to check out our new report .
I believe you will be very interested in the situation .
It 's hard to writers , writers , language , lend us your ears .
Well , actually your eyes will do .
Saturday arranged the Hell of a man who is widely known for the greatest writer in the English language .
He 26-year around 37 plays 37 plays and 154 around the world .
We are talking , of course about the amazing , boring course .
While his career may have been cut short , he died on April 23 , 1616 from April 23 , 1616 from a fever language and not to mention the English language itself .
It is actually that last point in his mind that we need to focus on in on on this post .
On four hundred years , it is time to show a little bit for a man who too many of us take for granted .
I have been informed , Shakespeare published , 884,647 throughout his way career .
While that does n't make him the most obvious writers in terms of sheer sheer volume , it 's a good quality .
What is the influence of his work on modern language ?
That is partially because during the 16th and 17th centuries , when Shakespeare was hard at work , English was a rogue .
The vocabulary being used was continuously used in place to understand things .
I believe his career is Shakespeare made contributions on both of these fronts .
A rich vocabulary , a unique way with words Shakespeare is good for having a vast vocabulary .
At a time , when English country is said to know just 3000 words on average conversation , Shakespeare was light of light years ahead .
In fact , he used as many as 15,000 words across his published works .
As such , he introduced many new words in daily life .
Some of these words are , many of those words , he created by himself changing it , changing , prefixes , and devising words , and devising words .
In a great way he can Rant Savagery Cold-blooded Dishearten Cold-blooded Dishearten and setting a original element with which to express ourselves .
It depends on the way Shakespeare structured out the way Shakespeare structured .
They are quick to point out that .
In order to see or not , We hope this post has helped cast a light on a light , so we can clearly see what is had on the words .
Perhaps you have not been inspired to go pick up a copy of Othello or a Midsummer Night 's lives today .
This year , we are excited to report from our business Breakfast in Stockholm .
We are thrilled to come together with friends and content with friends in the beautiful city .
It is not possible to has invited us 66 to a place where we can identify the secret .
Do not worry , we are not planning to start a secret society .
In either case , we are talking about how to engage in your audience and compete .
In my opinion the location is symbolic .
During the time of Industrial , a large number of Swedish , among them advances in mine .
Some even call it the Silicon of the 19th century .
We have put up to impressive history , we have put a lineup lineup of speakers challenges .
We are covering topics such as how to accelerate , build a standardized and reduce of global content .
It is the main topic is the challenge of can authoring , and can authoring , but while still staying , I can not recall .
We 'll be able to learn through the almost 2-mile-long , but Copco is mine .
We are sure we will get back to the surface with plenty of new ideas .
Thanks to everyone for joining and make this event possible .

If you use it every day , it is a chances that you are pretty adept at working with our content .
Are you sure you know all of the ins and outs and tips for getting the most out of our linguistic ?
Maybe , but we 're guessing there are a few things you probably do n't know even if you 've been at it for a while .
That is why at Content . We Content Connections , our online virtual conference in November 2015 .
Even though it 's Chief , Dr. Sabine , and can not show an insider , Dr. Adam Taylor , to provide an insider .
They offered up on their presentation , they offered up great , is advice spanning and managing .
The session was a fantastic deep dive into using the Acrolinx .

There is a lot of talk in the media these days .
On the one hand , there has been a steady flow of stories about how you are being used in incredible ways .
From the time to time , we see shining examples of some AI 's more publicized .
Do you remember , when it is a Watson , former champions on `` Jeopardy '' on Jeopardy ?
Do you know ?
What is amazing performance in the GoGames earlier this year ?
Whoever thinks that AI is a good thing .
It is Hawking , Elon , Musk , Musk , and Bill Gates are among the potential dangers of AI .
Whoever fears their fears was wrong , the reality is that AI is that AI is many decades from becoming sophisticated .
This leaves a lot of time to understand that never happens .
I would n't lose any sleep worrying about whether or not it will lose up against us .
I bring this up , not just because I find it all fascinating , but also because AI is becoming an important part of content .
It seems to understand that our own product can be the content of growing to the content of growing to the content of the content of growing in the content of growing in the content of the content of the existing companies within the content of the content of the existing content content within my possession of the existing content of the existing content content within the existing content of the content of the existing content existing within natural language existing .
When anything comes to deciding what , you and your company should be doing about AI and your content should bury things the way you always have .
It means having an army of writers and `` editors '' on staff that you want to write just the way you want them to write just the way you want them to write .
The problem is that this is an expensive gesture and one that does not take scale .
If you suddenly find yourself needing to double your content output , you will be hard pressed to oblige and trained all of the right people .
That hardly seems practical .
In the other end of the situation , we have got option two , which is to go all in on AI .
Having realized that AI can automate for you , you might decide to fire all of your writers .
It would be faster , but it is a lot less expensive .
Please remember , there is a problem here as well .
We are the fact that we are a long way from the point where we can replace human writers in the meantime .
If you were to rely on AI right now , you would find that your content would not be longer reflect your brand , engage your brand , or any of the other things .
It would not work .
Maybe 25 years from now will be a different story .
That leaves us with a option three . This is the best thing you can do .
It is embracing AI as a way to augment and enhance what you are doing .
The fact is that AI technologies can be incredibly effective at helping you create better content faster than you otherwise could .
It is on-brand and on-target .
However , it needs to be used in collaboration with your content creators , gently , gently , nudging .
In other words , you can not simply rely on these nature .
In order to reap their benefits , you have to embed them into your existing teams .
I believe great content is incredibly important .
In case you missed it , here is our latest research that explains why .
It 's a real competitive advantage to have a real advantage of their connect .
In our opinion , the companies that can leverage AI to help them on that journey will be better .
Speak about it , the deck in your favor .
Words are the building blocks of language .
They are what allow us to articulate and articulate , highly detailed pictures in other people 's minds .
If we have been able to conjure up a juicy , medium rare strip steak , for example , you would conjure up an image of what we were talking about .
You might even discover yourself , even though you are in the process , … .
Being our ability is our ability to associate meaning with them .
If you know what happns , then strip rare and strip steak all mean , then you know that it makes for a delightfully , mouthwatering .
I apologize , but we will have to agree to disagree .
This is a certain price of ideas that translators on do their work .
It is what allows them to say , `` It 's certainty that the brown dog '' is in German and communicate chien .
The problem is that sometimes translators into is that many languages have words and expressions for which there are no possibility .
They bring a unique , but richness in straws , translators .
Sometimes a small number of these words get adopted in English .
You should take the German word , `` It 's taking pleasure in someone else 's misfortune . ''
It is believed that the word is not universal .
Maybe that is why these days it is not uncommon to come across , schadenfreude and in writing .
People have it latched this word , so that it is now even in US .
There are many foreign words that are equally quirky , but not nearly as well .
They may put a smile on your face , some of them really convey great ideas .
The examples are : Abbiocco , Abbiocco , and eating a big meal .
It needs to be slapped .
I do n't know , but Portuguese act : `` The act of running your fingers through a lover 's hair . ''
I do n't believe you have never been to .
I believe it is Spanish and someone who is particularly sensitive to cold weather and temperatures .
It devotes herself , a woman , often old and lonely , who devotes herself to stray cats .
I am not sure of the purpose of going outside in the morning with the purpose of the purpose of going outside in the morning .
I Indonesian ( a joke told so poorly that one can not help but laugh . )
I can recall the Japanese language , `` The sunlight of the trees '' .
Why act in a way of scratching one 's head to remember the location of a misplaced object ?
I thought you are drunk when you thought it up .
I do n't know if you continue to eat an entire meal in spite of an entire meal .
It is Tampo from a person when one 's feelings have been hurt .
I am not sure , but Scottish dancers act like introducing someone because you have forgotten their name .
I 'm not sure , but Japanese a book left a book now after purchasing it .
I can sit outside on a sunny day if Norwegian is enjoying a beer .
It can be hard to nature between German and solitude .
We have some words like this in English too .
It is that others struggle to convey , at least in certain languages .
Do you have any plans for what they might be ?
This is a short list . It is hard to Catercorner Catercorner Geek Nerd Serendipity and unique flavor .
They may not be able to make it work , but they do make their jobs all the more interesting .
For today 's marketers , creating and distributing , and distributing is a top priority .
In fact , 88 percent of B2B organizations content marketing and as a recent IDC , notes notes .
I am in a certain situation and can recall adoption adoption of content over the past few years over the past few years .
The fact is that only 32 percent of B2B percent of B2B , while 30 percent consider it effective .
Things are better in B2C , where those numbers are 37 percent , and respectively .
So why are we not better at content marketing ?
A lot of content agree with the fact that the fact of content has to do with the fact that the majority of content marketers .
On the web is only part of the problem .
Even if you have got a world-class , you are never going to be a successful content . Unless you are creating great content .
And the great content begins with effective writing .
It may seem obvious , but it is worth calling out .
We are under constant pressure to create more content .
Unless we can hire more people , we often have to work faster or cut up with demand .
We turn to our minds around the business — , many of whom are not effective writers .
The quality of the content is the quantity of content we publish .
It is a real problem when the quality of your content goes down , it is a real problem .
That is because there is no such thing as neutral .
Anything that you publish that is not high quality can actually have a negative effect on your brand .
Not only that , according to a certain by translation Global on the provider of Global and grammar on website .
Of them , 59 percent old grammar and careless spelling mistakes would prevent them from making a website .
That is a very big deal .
In addition , not only does content quality audience impact audience , such as Google and Bing .
It 's Forrester that `` just as you 're judging '' , so the engines judge yours .
If you struggle to get past it , why would an engine show a page of content with errors ?
Of course , content quality is about a lot more than just spelling grammar .
It 's also determined to determined by things such as style , tone , and a clarity overall for engaging in engaging in engaging writing your audience , and creating a better overall customer experience .
The Closer comes at our own level . It is the case that the situation is so important , we need to see how effective the top brands are at writing great content .
We used our linguistic to evaluate the online content of 340 to evaluate and automotive .
We focused on our research on large , organizations , with more than $ 250 in annual revenue .
We looked at various types of content , including well , including well , well as corporate and technical product content .
We evaluated the overall of these companies by analyzing .
We examined their content against their content against best practices for standard grammar .
We are talking about things such as subject/verb and use of pronouns and double negatives .
I believe we evaluated on each company 's style on 62 separate and on our years .
We also looked at clarity , which is a measure of how easy a piece of how easy a piece of content .
As part of our circumstances , we gave each company a score for quality and clarity .
The address is a proprietary - we used these results to derive an overall content score score for each company .
Based on our experience , we have determined that companies an companies content score score of 72 or higher in their content to be effective .
As it turns out , most of the companies we have not reached the level of content sophistication just yet .
The lyrics are as follows : `` What We Learned About How Effective About Writing , and 85 '' points scores of the 340 .
Not only is that only because we were surprised to discover that less than one-third .
I am the differ of growing adoption between growing adoption because of the content of content marketing marketing .
With more than two-thirds producing it , we think content marketers .
I believe the data from a regional and industry perspective is greater than this .
The content quality tends to be relatively content from - to region content to region with scores of 69.5 , the Middle East , and Africa .
When you look at the industry section of the industry , it is a exception of one exception — .
Do you know Impact , but Industry has the Best It ?
Our research is not to call for specific companies .
I have said that , we do want to recognize a handful of the top-performing companies by showcasing .
These companies include American department store , Kohl is clearly taken care to create content with a warm , friendly , and inviting from home .
Whether you are overhauling on your space or just tweaking , and accents in the styles you are looking for .
From feminine , tiny , shabby , and modern , Kohl , Kohl and function to your home .
I am a top performer , but it is a company that is known for implementing .
I was wrong in the recent blog that their content should be wrong .
Similar to the amount of northeastern United States United States United States has been buried — WITH snow .
The community has a new issue , but it is not true .
The town wanted to borrow it for the Christmas parade .
We said they could not plow it to take snow !
The lyrics are : Down Under , , National Australia provides a great example of how financial services are able to provide practical practical practical practical practical for practical services .
Consider your car like your body — , would you carry a backpack if you did not need to ?
Of course not , it would make you tired , thirsty , and give you a headache back .
It carries the same — as the more fuel , the more fuel , and the more wear it , the more wear it and suspension .
It is important for a rest of the money effects , such as a rest break at the mechanic , and more money spent on maintenance .
Will you be your nature in all the way you are ?
Although content is a very important part of marketing world , the quality of their content is very important to their content for their content .
We have seen , most of the 340 we reviewed are producing content that just does not measure up .
We believe those companies , and the countless others like them , will be handicapped if they do not start paying more attention to their content .
The following article is a guest post from `` Val '' Swisher .
The article originally appeared in an April 2016 post .
Last month , Google announced `` Google Cloud '' Machine Machine .
It is a new , but it can allows you to incorporate you to some of the same services into your applications that applications use .
A services include image search engines such as photos , voice search , and a Translate .
Google writes : Google Cloud provides modern machine learning modern machine learning modern machine learning modern machine . It can generate pre-trained .
The features of the machine learning , the machine learning the machine learning the Google Translate .
This allows you to link to Google Translate for a fee and applications .
However , do you know that there is a certain way to use Google Moor on your website ?
It is called the Google Translate , Gadget , and it is not new .
It has been around since 2009 .
In a nutshell , the Earth Gadget allows you to provide a little translate button on your website .
Usually , it is implemented box and allows anyone on your page to have the content translated into one of the languages listed in the drop-down .
You can have multiple , rather translating on your website available .
It is free of all .
Using the doors is incredibly easy .
You incorporate it on your webpage , and you are your content gets it into a different language .
There is no more than sure , it is a real '' translation .
There is no more having to maintain multiple websites for multiple languages .
Wait a little bit . You should be thinking about now .
Do I really want to have people use free google team on my precious website ?
Do you have my intervention ?
Who knows what the translation will look like in it ?
And if those responses are running through your head , I commend you .
You have been paying attention .
Free translation is free .
This is not a guarantee .
I am not sure .
Not for your company .
Only free .
As most of my readers , I am not a fan of using free readers translation , for anything more valuable than reading a letter from Paris .
Surely , you would not want to use free , as it is real content .
I am beginning to see Level Research the other day by Level Research the other day uses the other day .
Here are a few that I have come up with ; User-generated is .
I believe one of the most difficult types of content is definitely one of the most difficult types of content .
The nature of user-generated is fluid .
It is not planned , there is no limit .
It gets there on your community page , whenever someone decides to write it .
The good news is that no one wants to user-generate to make any sense .
After all , the source content barely makes sense .
Most people can not put together strings of sentences that are correct .
There is a great level of acceptance for poor , even of user-generated .
But , at least it is somewhat translated .
The translation will be done .
It is base base .
I have been told that people are also quite forgiving of knowledge base .
As you support your support , it would be very handy to publish them , it would be very helpful to have the information in a different language .
I agree with much knowledge base .
It is often published as people request it . With no time for a time for a grammatical , localization and full-on .
It is better to have somewhat information available in different languages than nothing .
You are sixteen popular popular languages .
Let us face it , but translation , when done well , can be time consuming and expensive .
It is possible for you to have a small market in another country .
It is possible that use free term for free using Google Search for Google . Or will work well enough on your content to satisfy the people of that kind .
I 'd prefer to have somewhat information available .
The better results can be the better results if you use Google for the free google team .
Before you slap the gadget on your site , make sure your English site is global-ready .
Make sure that your content is optimized for translation .

Did you know that a lot of computer technology Lenovo ?
We are talking about hundreds of individual pieces every month .
It is a great thing that you would never guess is being written overseas .
However , that was n't always the case .
The fact that the fact is that when Lenovo is first , it is a Personal issue , IBM is more than a decade to support it , and then built a new content team .
It 's not possible to master the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content and exceptional English language . Is it simply the case of the ability to combine a description of the brand brand in the area of the Lenovo ?
As a result , the content produced stood out as different and left readers with the clear impression that it was being created .
That meant that it had to be heavily edited by a team of the United States before it could be published .
I am trying to solve the problem , however , started using it .
It was an attractive solution to a variety of reasons .
It would integrate into their content , but give the writers that real-time , and give the writers real-time over time to become better writers over time .
It was a matter of whether it was fully in their standards . They used it to apply all of their standards , such as terminology , specifically with terminology , such as terminology .
But it was n't just for these reasons that can just chose Acrolinx .
It is also also being used to Keith 's product , a senior software engineer at Keith 's product , Lenovo , and had company 's product content .
And once we learned about how much we would save in translation , we were told it would pay for itself in translation .
Using Acrolinx had an immediate impact on Lenovo .
Suddenly the people who had been producing it , it was a content of their job .
It can be easier to read , Acrolinx also helped make the content more to translate .
For a company like Lenovo Lenovo Lenovo millions of dollars each year , that 's a big deal .
Actually , it is paid for itself in the fact that 24 months of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands in translation .
It could not be happier with the results .
We completely transformed our content with Acrolinx .
We have been able to exceed our ability to exceed the ability to exceed our ability to sacrifice quality quality .
The cost that we are getting from translation is just the cake .
People often say that a company 's brand is most valuable , and in many ways I believe they are correct .
It is because you brand your brand personified .
It is the way that you look , sound , and act as though it is a big role in how people perceive your company .
Not surprisingly , companies with great brands stand out , while those that do not have them often .
There are many factors that play a role in it , if a brand will be successful , one of the most important , touchpoint .
When it comes to your content , that means that you always need to sound more or less the same by having a voice , style , and tone .
Unfortunately , the consistency can be really hard to do at scale .
That is particularly true if you have hundreds or even thousands of writers in your understand spread all over the world .
But when it comes to building your brand , it is essential .
Let me explain why .
I have the Case president for Consistent in a recent article . I noted that `` in the game of customer '' experience will always help you .
The point Jake is making is as simple as it is important .
A lot .
For most companies , most of the things for communicating with communicating with their opinions is their content and how you say it has a critical role to play in understand those experiences .
It 's also important to point out that when the quality of your content is not consistent , it can confuse your spelling .
For instance , it might create the impression that they are being sold to by many different people , than a single , unified organization .
In turn , can damage your brand .
On the other hand , when your content is consistently good , it helps create better customer experiences .
That helps you build trust , credibility , and a great reputation .
But do not take my word for it .
There are plenty of independent , but I can not research this .
I have noted a few of my favorite examples below : According to Forrester , have a consistent experience of brand trust .
A study by McKinsey of 27,000 consumers found that a consistent customer increases customer , and boosts .
In a related article , the authors noted that it may not seem sexy , but I am not sure if it is the secret .
It is hard for the companies that focus on consistency .
In fact , research by Techipedia . However , brands are worth 20 percent more than those that are not .
As their content , it may seem like a nice-to-have , the reality is that it is that it is essential for creating the kinds of positive customer that companies .
Okay , but here is the thing . The content is n't very consistent .
We know it is because we have done the research that proves it .
It is Marketing Research on Content , Consistency , we have a history of lots of companies .
If you have not already , check out our statistics Content to see what I mean .
In the meantime , we recently decided to take that research and analysis on the subject .
In order to score a girl 's content , it is score a like a like a king and a like a king overall .
I am talking about things like their corporate communication , marketing , and support content .
We wanted to see if all of those different types of quality would be of quality quality level of quality companies .
A spoiler is that they were n't .
I am stating I am stating the obvious , but I should point out here that different types of content are typically written and maintained others .
So while each type of content has a different use , is needed , is needed at different points , and is written by different points .
Fast forward to our research project .
Let me give you a quick overview of what we did .
We used our software to score the unique sections of 170 , score content , including their blog , and support content .
So far with me so far ?
We calculated about the variance between the highest and lowest scoring .
Based on our research , and experience , we determined that companies with a variance , or less have content that is sufficiently clear to help them .
On the other hand , companies in our view , companies with a variance of that inconsistency .
Here 's what we Learned About Content , 46 percent of the companies we analyzed than seven points .
In other words , nearly half of the companies are creating content that is sufficiently consistent .
However , as I alluded to that before , just having consistent content is not good enough .
It has to be consistently good content .
That is where we found some problems .
It 's a company of the companies we looked at proved able to consistently produce high-quality ability to produce high-quality ability .
In fact , 19 of them only created too created created to content the content of the business .
You do not have to be a rocket scientist to read between the lines .
What that means is the majority of the companies that we analyzed from this category .
In fact , 13 percent of them were at the polar opposite end of the spectrum , not only having it or more .
To put it another way , while all of these companies had content we considered to be low-quality , just how bad it was varied from section of their website .
For those thirteen of companies , having both really feelings and can be content is a real problem .
As a matter of fact , you might be tempted to be tempted to disregard a small amount of sample as an an an an an an an an an small portion of the companies we have already fully communicated and can not fathom the ability to comprehend both of the ability to comprehend or understand the ability to content content .
Also , please do not forget that the vast majority of companies — to improve the quality of their content .
Why should you say so ?
Do not understand what all of this means you are a customer engaging in a sexual relationship with a brand brand brand for the first time .
Let 's pretend that your initial point of contact is reading a news item that you find online .
It is not particularly obvious that the news interests you , so you decide to check a few of the company 's products .
Some of that product content reads well , and really speaks to you , some of it does not .
What can I do ?
The company probably starts to feel a bit too forward to you .
Some of the pages you read contain errors while others do not .
It is almost as if the company has several several voices or personalities .
You might even get the impression that the company you are dealing with is n't coordinated or working together .
Yes , that may not be an issue for you , but it should be an early warning sign that the company you are dealing with or not .
Listen to some of the company 's Q & As and other support content , it is not as good as some support content .
For an unrelated number of can , content can be a red flag that signals there could be a potential problem that could be a potential problem .
At a time , when they expect spectacular customer experiences and for those experiences , and seemingly seemingly seemingly seemingly play a pivotal .
After all , in a world full of choices , why accept a bad customer experience if a better one might just be a few clicks away ?
I can recall things from some recent research from some recent research and Company 's showing the high level of correlation .
While this research is specific to the specific research , it is fair to the banking .
What is driving These Inconsistent ?
If publishing is a problem , the question becomes a problem , what is driving these inconsistent experiences ?
Although there was n't any pattern that emerged through our brain , we identified some trends .
For example , 25 percent of inconsistent companies had the biggest problem within their product pages .
That means that you can see a significant difference in the style , clarity and quality of the content from another product to another product .
This is often the case when different product are responsible for developing content for developing content for their individual product , but fail to fail .
It is a problem for multiple products but a single buyer is a problem .
I am 23 percent of the companies that we surveyed about the biggest content score when comparing their product with their support content .
For these companies , the old adage of high-gloss from high-gloss , monochromatic .
They can see a material difference between the style , clarity , and quality of the product content that they engage in with .
I should point out here that although these content serve are purposes serve as the others .
There is no doubt in my mind that the kind of can likely have an impact on brand perception .
The key is that if your company has many different teams , no way it 's of standardizing , and it 's of damaging damaging content .
Where to From Here ?
Just customer can be under the top of the gun to create better , become under the gun , to create better , more consistent content .
It 's high-quality , but one-fifth is doing this successfully , but within the companies we expect are become business-critical .
The question is Will you be ready when it does ?
The words we read has many power because they can make us feel any number of ways .
You have to think about the last great book you enjoyed .
The words are similar to the author , `` Spare conspired to create a sense of terror '' or to make you laugh .
It 's not the result of the author wrote , but also how the author decides to write it .
When it comes to the business world , the words you use are equally powerful and important .
That is because they provide your tone of voice , which is critical for your target audience and giving them a clear impression .
At Acrolinx , we spend a lot of time talking about tone of voice .
In case you missed it , you will find quite a few posts about it on our blog , or you can click your way through the subject , or click your way through the situation .
The most important thing about tone of voice is that most people tend to think .
It is possible that you know what type of voice you like .
Even though you are writing to your writing , you may even try to sign your writing .
But , it does not have to be that way .
I believe you are writing the song `` The Taste of Your Lives '' is the tone of your writing .
This is at Acrolinx , we can use our minds analytics to score the clarity , and liveliness of your content .
The three factors play an important role , not just in determining the voice of your content , but also going to resonate .
To show you what we mean , let us look at short wheelchairs that we 've borrowed from the hood to see the things you are looking under .
Every changes affect every changes , but the user with large lists will only be able to pay special attention .
What we like about the text is casual , humor tone .
When referring to `` cool , '' I believe it 's cool . What 's happening under the neighborhood , the content of the content is very approachable and personable .
Do you understand what the authors are trying to convey ? You also get the sense of soulless , soulless corporation .
Instead , you get the impression that it is a business that is a business that has some personality and interested in you on a more personal , one-to-one .
When we analyze the content with Acrolinx , that is reflected in the content scores .
It is relatively clear , plus , plus , informal is and lively , and it is inappropriate for a business .
We take our hats off to MailChimp for creating some great content .
If we can convey some changes to the content , we can convey the same ideas in a different way .
The purpose of today 's post is to outline , the various changes that we understand .
The changes affect affect users , but if you have large lists , you should pay particular attention to this post .
We have strived to make the content clearer , but to do so had to sacrifice some of it .
While that may work well for content that you need to have translated , the result is text .
It is a bit more stiff and it can be .
Here is how that content scores : Below is a third version of the text with some additional changes .
It also depends on the same ideas , but it does so in a much less clear and way .
It is long-winded and feels very impersonal .
It is not fun to read and does not give you the sense of the sense .
It is developers to have made numerous changes to the platform , all of which will be reviewed in today 's post .
I believe that all MailChimp MailChimp by users by these changes ; however , users who have particularly large email recipient is especially advised to pay particular attention .
Of course , it is reflected in the content of the content called With the addition of our changes , it is no longer great content .
Sure it does the job of conveying , but it does n't do so particularly well .
I believe it is because I believe it is true , however , I believe art , but , of course , Personas , even though you need to develop the right voice for each of your target .
And while there is no problem approach — , one company is ideal to figure out what voice you 're consistently writing .
That is where Acrolinx can be most helpful .
This allows you to build voice profiles for each of your customer preferences .
That way , you have got a benchmark for clarity , informality and which you can then strive for that persona .
That means that as you are writing , you are getting real-time about how to target your specific audience for your specific audience .
It is better to be content with a few months to helping you , but it is easier to create better content .
Because voice is such an important part of creating great content , we think our software is particularly useful , but on-target is useful , but on-target is .
In a world , where both B2C and companies are moving to more casual and conversational writing .
Asking people where they are going to buy their donuts and they will vote for in an election .
They can have strong points of view , where they grew up usually has a lot to do with it .
Considering that Americans eat over ten billion doughnut every year , it 's a food that many year donuts . It 's a food that many of us seem to be familiar with .
And the good news is that , unlike politics , make it easy for people to come together .
After all , no matter whether they are radio ' Donuts ' , Krispy is , or any other variety , who is ever going to say no .
Plus , donuts . You may have another thing that you may not be aware of . to help you become a better writer .
It is a shocking gesture , however , we trust us , we take a moment to let that sink in .
Even goodness , you can doughy your ticket .
In honor , in honor , in honor , Donut and being in honor of ourselves , we have taken it upon ourselves .
You need to sit back and salivate on all the things you can learn about writing from our dear friend .
You have always got to nail the basics .
It does not matter how much you put on your worships or how much jelly or cream you put in them .
If you do not start out with a truly good batter , or dough , you are never going to wind up with a great product .
The same is the same as the content you write .
You can dress it up with great pictures , catchy headlines , but at the end of the day you will be disappointed .
Be sure to focus on writing clear , engaging in writing and engaging in enjoyable content .
I can flavors everything to life .
Maybe you like it on your face or just a basic glaze .
Are you a bit more adventurous and enjoy bacon ? Perhaps Loops by Loops by Loops yourself and yourself .
Whatever it is that floats your boat , those extra , those extra flourishes to you and keep you coming back again .
It is the same thing with writing .
While you can not garnish bacon , posts your blog posts .
What you can do is your content with a truly distinctive of voice that makes it stand as being uniquely .
That is something that great brands are doing more and helps them to build a stronger connection with their brain .
Sometimes you have a twist .
By default , most of us thinking about donuts as circles with a hole .
Let us not forget about the twist .
It is less common , intriguing , and unexpected .
When it comes to writing , it can be easy to get stuck in , where you just turn out the same thing over and over again .
That is boring for you and for your readers , so do not let it happen .
You should figure out how to include how to include include blog and turns in your writing and to deliver the blog posts .
The quality is quantity .
About the choice , would you rather have a dozen mediocre donuts or one killer afterwards ?
Why admittedly your are while reading this could sway your decision ?
It is the same with content .
People want to consume good things , so do n't waste their time .
Focus on creating the best content that you can .
You may not be able to publish as much as a result , but you will get much better results if you do .
A donut a day ?
It 's time to come clean .
We do n't actually recommend that you start eating doughnut every day .
However , I 've said that you do hope that you enjoyed our tribute our tribute to the `` mighty donut '' the next time you sit down to write .
I am happy and eating and writing .
You should not be shy , — in just us your best , enjoying the the time , and the day you will buy them a gift .
I am uncertain .
If you are a marketer , then you probably know how important content is to the success of your business .
After all , it is the voice of your brand . It is the fuel that drives new sales and customer loyalty .
You can test enough to appreciate the fact that the quality of your business is directly related to the impact .
We are going to go out on a limb , and guess that the answer is no .
How often do you take the time to actually optimize your content ?
It 's clear that it 's really well written , that it has the right tone of voice , that 's clear and easy to understand .
It is probably not as often as you should be , correct ?
Unfortunately , many people marketers 's why wind up wasting up wasting thousands and in some cases , even millions and content .
The funny thing is that they are , then left scratching their heads when they discover that it does not deliver the results .
In this post , we are going to explain why content quality is therefore very important .
Unlike this year , Proof is positive that is better than this year . We did some research to try to prove that better content drives better business results .
Just to be clear , we are not talking about problems .
Basically , we mean major things in the core , it matter most of the things today 's matter .
As part of our research , we surveyed over 800 professionals .
All of the input we gathered by doing so points to one clear finding better content really does lead to better business .
Let us explain the answer .
First , we started off by asking the participants to name what they thought were the top three business of having poor-quality content .
It is the graph below what they said , but virtually everyone agreed , but virtually everyone agreed about what those implications are .
Our customer engagement can be found in the same level of trust , therefore , trust and lower customer engagement .
You can probably do n't make the case .
Our primary step is to try to quantify our business metrics on business .
We segmented our way into two groups , sending each other a piece of marketing surgery .
Although the content and messaging were completely virtually the quality for the quality , we made sure to vary the quality .
The piece of gifts is a received of above-average , based on the quality rate it was just average .
I can see the two versions of the text below , they are all in it .
You can see a pretty dramatic difference in the scores and if you read the text , you will see a difference in how well written they are .
By the way , it is important to note that this was an independent blind study , where participants only saw one version of the content .
After it , we asked them some questions , which was led to some questions and brand brand results .
Only 23 years of the way who received the low-scoring first , impression of Xtera .
Almost 60 percent of the respondents who received the high-scoring .
The quality of the content of the content of the content of the content , we were able to increase positive brand in the random audience .
Picture the impact on the content of content in the content of target a very specific group of target customers .
I believe the next step is to measure . We wanted to measure the correlation between the content between the content and conversion .
To sign up , we included a call to action in our sample marketing and encouraging up for a free trial .
We then asked our question how likely they would be to sign up based on the quality of the content they had read .
We were all to see that the folks who received the average-quality percent likely to sign up for the free trial .
It is a big deal considering how important increasing is for generating and nurturing .
What our findings is that by improving the quality of your content , you can dramatically it .
In order to create the last thing , we wanted to quantify was the last thing and intent to purchase .
We asked our lovely , why likely they would be to purchase from our quality of the content they had just read .
I who was among the respondents , intent to purchase was 104 percent than the respondents than among the respondents .
This is perhaps the most obvious insight we research from our research .
The business Road to Better to Better Begins can yield significant others .
That is why it is so important to you your content .
We saw meaningful differences in brand perception , but , conversion , and intent to purchase between people who received great content .
The purpose is clear .
Things matters more than most of us realize and to truly optimize and truly our content marketing .
Having a defined plan in place , or better yet , to your content , is critical .
In our way , and based on the data we have shared , it is the key to the key to the return on the considerable investment in the considerable price .
At Acrolinx we have got a very clear mission .

As part of our commitment to fulfilling that mission , we are always looking at ways to use our content , optimization so it is a powerful and effective for you to use .

It 's Automation , Automation is a global provider of industrial years , and manufacturing industries , and manufacturing industries .
Most companies - the Milwaukee-based is always trying to produce more with less .
It is not only keeping up with a growing demand for great content , but also making it available in a variety of languages .
Even a global company with more than anything , 20,000 and high-quality can remain in a relationship .
About the international nature of the business , there is managing .
I decided that it was outdated translation , but management is outdated translation to more cost-effective .
It is in Kathleen Kathleen , in case it is hard to Content and Content .
When Kathleen began looking for possible possible , she discovered an article written that Val Swisher .
Even though she soon , our content can help .
After learning about it , she found out that we could help her company automate , as well as create better , and less expensive .
Eventually she signed up Rockwell to start using the platform .
It 's Path to Acrolinx , sometimes decided to make Rockwell from Rockwell .
She selected a small team of writers and the editors .
She used some basic training for them , and let them use Acrolinx for several months using the software 's out-of-the-box .
I am having several approach , but I am not sure .
First of all , it allowed her to obtain a lot of feedback about what worked well for Rockwell and what would require it to align .
All of this opening would later go to good use when she rolled out the software more .
It helped all of the things to the rest of the organization because she had real data that she had real data .
It was the last and perhaps biggest advantage of Kathleen 's approach 's approach was that she was able to transform this group of software into the software .
They ultimately ultimately given served as ambassadors to the rest of the company .
Doing so meant that they were available to answer questions and provide support within the momentum and enthusiasm .
I Rockwell that Rockwell used to great success was turning one of their editing resources in admin , admin .
The person in charge of managing in managing of managing , such as the terminology library , such as the terminology , and everything ran smoothly .
I enterprise had a fairly large , boring Acrolinx in the enterprise .
They were Kathleen and her team decided that their mantra was going to be `` happy adoption '' and they did a great job .
It is hard to being well organized and taking the time to customize and approach the approach in order to customize the approach .
The Results Today Rockwell , Rockwell more than 300 minutes — .
The company is writers and the best place to use Acrolinx .
One of the biggest issue has been that with , Rockwell has been able to simplify it .
Even in the past writers would have been confirm that they were using the right terms by thousands of the right terms by thousands of the right terms they use the right terms of the content .
Thank you to this and the general improvements quality for content is translation to its translation .
For example , the manuals that Rockwell has been producing it since it started using Acrolinx and have on both time and money .
They used to be happier .
It helped make their team more efficient and editors in Rockwell that they 've made their team more efficient .
It can be felt to adopt the situation from July
In it , the Founding Fathers that the 13 American colonies colonies that the 13 American colonies that should no longer be subject .
With the stroke of a pen , or more likely , the United States of America was born .
While Independence Day may be a great experience to reflect on the subject of our nation , we will stop the history lesson .
We are content after all , not history buffs .
I think that it is worth taking a moment of Independence is one of the most important pieces of content ever written . We think it is worth taking a moment to appreciate .
At 1,337 , it is not a terribly long document . It is not a terribly long document . Just twice the length of this blog , and packs a real punch of words .
In case you need a refresher , one of the Declaration 's best-known in the preamble , `` We hold these truths to be self-evident '' .
This one sentence is not only almost ; it is also been said to contain some of the `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` American history '' and `` words in American history '' .
It was the power of these words that helped to inspire the country , that ultimately allowed us to create the country that we know today .
More Than others , they are many lessons that can be learned from the Declaration , that inspires others to take care of others .
It is not a small feat if you work for a B2B and spend days complex products to support them .
While it takes things , I 'm not sure where you can put you on the path to creating great content that resonates with your audience .
That includes your audience .
Find out who you are writing for . What is going to inspire and motivate them ?
To do this , you have to do your homework and take the time to learn about your voice and pain for that audience for that audience .
You need to tailor about your tone of voice to match the people you 're writing for .
In Today , the World that can not means adopting a voice that is more casual and conversational . It is important to figure out what kind of voice you have .
Do you need help with this ?
Check out our voice on tone of voice .
Ensure .
Make sure that once you know your audience , what tone of voice is consistently in the content you create .
If you do not , you risk creating confusion among your target audience and that you are not aligned and that you are not aligned with .
The last year you celebrate the fourth of July and sit back to watch the fireworks .
I am unsure of the situation with the exception of children .
As a content creator , it is your job to try to do the same thing with every new piece of content you publish .
While that stresses it to it , I believe that knowing your audience , adopting the audience , adopting the tone of that tone will certainly help you .
I believe it is everywhere .
It is getting out of hand .
It was difficult to manage because recently , it was difficult to manage , because recently , it was seldom worthy of measurement .
That is quickly changing .
It takes the way out of business .
I believe metrics metrics companies to focus their efforts .
Just allows us to know whether the time , effort and money is worth it .
I can not provide us with data on which we can make informed informed of this business .
It is to create content , we must measure our content against a formal set of quality criteria .
In order to scale process we must automate as much as possible .
From leveraging the power of computers and artificial intelligence , we can do that today .
I need a lot of it ; it is Scorecard that we choose to use have a impact on others .
It sounds as though we know this .
The right words can inform .
The wrong ones can confuse , confound , and contradict .
I do n't know why the personality of your brand .
It often represents the first impression of your company .
It projects your values and sets expectations for equally .
Believe it , Producing is critical to business success .
The quality content follows follows rules : rules , sentence , and grammar .
It is easy to read and understand .
I believe content is in style and structure content in style and tone of voice .
Some writers can have been responsible for ensuring it without the right words .
The content of the content is high in my opinion .
However , their best efforts is their best efforts and writers are certain .
Not only that , they are not scalable .
I believe with a lengthy , believe with style guides ; it can happen with a lengthy , learn with a lengthy , writers lengthy experience .
When they make a mistake , an editor is expected to catch the error .
That is not always what happens .
It is often possible to make mistakes and are just as likely to make mistakes .
Most editors rely on outdated mechanical , manual processes processes to catch an increasing , and financial risks .
I believe it can not provide us with a set of rules quality against which to measure content .
What are Performance in ?
Even though it is management tools designed to help us monitor our progress over time toward an progress .
It can contain targets items ( goals that we strive to achieve ) and key performance whether we are reaching our goals or not .
I believe performance commonly understood visual metaphors to allow us to quickly decide whether or not we are on the right track .
The data they present are the visual answer to the question . How well are we doing ?
It 's scorecards in use all industry industry in mind .
They are most effective when they are designed to capture rewards in the system .
As leadership as John E. Jones once said , `` What gets measured gets done ? ''
What gets measured and fed gets done well .
What is it that gets it gets repeated ?
I wonder why Content is Performance in Performance and weaknesses Performance .
They help us see opportunity for improvement , provide us with a way to prioritize the efforts of our efforts .
Your performance performance manually manually slow , but it may be possible .
It can be valuable when most valuable tools we use to create content .
Even though automatically capturing real-time relevant and providing it to content creators .
faster can time-to-market and reduced are some of the benefits .
I can not believe it is Content . Why Performance Fail are not magical .
They do not do anything by themselves .
Their value is heavily dependent on how they are executed .
The biggest reasons why performance it is disagreement over what data it is , how to measure and collect it , and what the possibility is .
To be successful , scorecard must be defined in the same way by everyone using it .
All parties involved must agree with the definition of common being collected .
I findings measured and specific actions taken .
There are other reasons why you fail .
It is one of the most important to recognize is that some people do not like the idea of being monitored .
There are many reasons why some people dislike being believe .
Just measuring attention to details .
Not everyone wants to scrutiny their work .
Secondly , some people see performance in the manner of a way to measure their personal performance .
It is used to ensure most of those things are not used to monitor people .
It is important to ensure that performance in the subject level of communication , therefore it is important to communicate what is actually being measured .
For example , the marketing communication team at Illumina , a Silicon team at Illumina , determine what content performs the best .
Some writers use software to score software to score in real time they create in real time .
The software measures is to a standard linguistic , grammar , and spelling .
It also provides proof scores scores and allows the company to encode and corporate terminology rules .
Before publication , each piece of content is scored .
Only due to each other produced in the content of stored in the company 's content management .
The marketing team combines content quality content scores from Acrolinx , length of actions , and on-site .
Do this to show that content in the content of that content does not matter .
It has found that content that content quality standards can be found standards .
It is in Action , but it can be I wrote the first draft of this article without help of content scoring .
Once I was happy with it , I sent it to an editor .
Then , we ran the edited draft through understand .
The draft scored scored well , 77 out of 100 , but there were grammar .
And it was n't written as clearly as it could have been .
However , with a few changes recommended by Acrolinx , I was able to make improvements my overall Acrolinx .
I spotted some errors that can just during the writing and editing process .
Using a scorecard scorecard makes producing quality quality the focus of our work , not micromanaging and editors .
I believe it is designed to guide content creators toward the creation of quality quality .
I believe that complies with an rules set of rules .
I believe that follows an simply style .
I am sure that meets customer goals and helps us achieve business goals .
To create content at scale , we can not rely on human editors .
Instead , we must leverage the power of software to help us .
We must automate the process process as possible .
We can do that today , by leveraging about it today .
It 's the dog days of summer .
It is hot out , the sun is shining , and maybe you wish you were at the beach rather than at work .
At times like these , it can be easy to get distracted , feel less distracted , feel less than inspired and not to do your work .
Everyone is on vacation , darn .
Should I be too ?
Someone has to work ( including your friends on the Acrolinx ) and as long as we do , should n't we aim to do the best job we can ?
Maybe that is easier said than done .
Especially if you are reading this while sitting next to a window on a sunny day . Just aching .

They came to talk and exchange ideas about the challenges that they are facing and executing their content .
Since you are very well facing these challenges , we wanted to briefly share them with you .
I believe I can not recall the demand for the demand of the seemingly endless appetite , it 's Keeping up with the Never-Ending and realities .

the article is similar to the content of content and asked the question : `` How does your content rate ? ''
The last year , content quality quality quality can be downloaded released the initial level of ear Content .
It 's proprietary of global content quality , Acrolinx employed , quality is employed in 20 million words .
Even though pages of marketing , corporate , technical content , and customer support content seemed to be reggae , additionally , the main Give of the content is Cuban and how readable is the content of content content .
In fact , the companies examined earned overall content scores below , the lowest threshold impact below .
In the most certain manner in which it is analyzed of the nature in which it covers analyzed , regardless of where the content in the content the content occurred .
It is possible for scored scored the highest in content in content at an average of 73.2 .
I do Telecommunications companies on the other hand , earned an average score of 66.2 .
There was a small silver lining .
It 's to avoid 46 % of the companies scrutinized that 46 of the companies had scores brand brand content .
The key takeaway is that a 81 % of enterprises need to improve content quality , or both .
Adding salt to the wound , a follow-up study can not study less than 20 % of these companies .
It is in the fashion Marketing Content of marketers .
However , with greater content comes understand .
Ramos , and inferior quality are often the result .
Add to the level of mix consumer .
It is a study of British , although I found that content quality is unnecessary to purchase .
It can be repaired from a company of poor grammar or spelling errors .
Five years ago , when the market started exploding around content , there was a shift in digital channels .
That massive shift created a gigantic shift created , which resulted in content to perform .
But these companies have no way to measure how well the content is performing other than anecdotal .
It 's like driving a car down the road at 100 miles and trying to navigate to navigate by learning how this content will perform .
Believe that global quality is way below average and average average quality is way below .
People content have a major impact of competitiveness , has a major impact to lack of competitiveness .
Also , inconsistent content content causes their attention to multiple people and can marketed their brand .
However , content with the quality of quality quality produces quality , can it happen in hard to trust and reputation for the company and satisfaction .
I am unsure of study , but Company bears this out .
Just conversion three-fold released by Acrolinx of this year .
I believe you should go to the place where the expectations of two key research can be found Before notes .
In the situation , we wanted to elevate the conversation about content in the situation .
This solves are investing in content to help their businesses .
Most have no idea how to measure and improve their content .
We wanted to introduce to a audience of content .
We have a unique technology engine that can score score thousands of pieces of content .
And it is possible to quantify quality quality .
Ask who should be paying attention to the data , and he will tell you that it is in every content professional .
There is a reflection of the brand marketing .
The middle managers and the other marketing responsible for marketing responsible for supervising supervising a long before the content is published .
People especially need to be aware , as they are in a position to create content for a wide range of topics and services are often responsible for the brand terms of products and services .
The challenge is that many companies operate in mind .
Imagine it . A huge company like IBM , like trying to get thousands of employed the same way .
It 's impossible to get that many people writing content consistently based on some kind of defined guide .
Especially when you add the complexity of different languages , and different brands .
It is in the case to Improve Steps to Improve the situation , and it is a busy company .
If there is a minimum of concern in every situation acknowledges as to an important topic , just like product quality .
The second way is must have an objective way to measure content .
And third tools and new tools should be adopted that help many time .
It adds priority to priority to priority because they give priority to priority .
Have you gotten caught up in all of the Pokémon Go hype ?
If you have not , at the least you probably know someone who has .
You have seen it covered in the news or in your social media feeds .
You have gotten to enjoy the truly bizarre experience of watching people swarm .
Even though Justin is caught playing the game in the middle of Central Park the other day .
If you happen to be one of the do , let us quickly explain it .
This was in early July , but Pokémon was a free , location-based .
It uses your camera 's camera and can attempt to help you track down little creatures .
Part of the game 's appeal is the nostalgia of the childhood favorite .
It is the original difference games where popular in the mid to late , but in the end .
I have been a sensation that has not only millions of fans , but also sent Nintendo 's stock soaring soaring soaring soaring .
What does love is happening with Content ?
If we take a step back from all of the excitement , there are some valuable lessons to be learned from them .
Do not hesitate to hesitate because those lessons are the old favorite .
I believe that we noted above , however , Pokémon is not new .
It is 20 years old , and it has been given new life .
Be a little to all of you content that you can dust off your old , top-performing , and put them to work for you again .
We are not suggesting that you simply have , however .
Although Pokémon is a nod to an old classic , it is exciting .
You have to take a similar approach with your content .
That means it is difficult with the latest information . Insert it into context , and even giving it a new design .
If you do it well , you can get extra entirely out of an existing piece , which is often easier than starting something new from scratch .
Always strive to go viral .
It 's to achieve the kind of widespread , visibility .
Of course , making that dream a reality is easier said than done .
You should go , the secret has been tapping into the nostalgia factor , making a version of the game and making it free to get your hands on .
While there is no silver bullet to creating it content , if you study examples , you may start to figure how to create your own .
Stay on the cutting edge .
In reality , part of the appeal of Pokémon . That is the bit that allows those viruses to appear .
As content why we can easily default our standard , we can default our standard eBooks , and distributing .
But the reality is that within a couple of years , the types of content we need to produce that content is set to change .
As an example , apps apps may gain popularity , they may very well become the dominant at the same time .
What it all comes down to is that if you have not played it , then you should .
You should let it go because you can find new ways to improve your content .

The first is to check your content to see if it is actually copying someone else 's .
If you google around , you can find a variety of tools .

There is nothing wrong with borrowing someone else 's words or ideas , provided you make it clear to your audience that is what you are doing .

They support a specific use , but they can not explain the question .
What do we like by `` Why ? ''
Your vision is your vision and your reason for being .
You are why is it consistent ?
Your goals and it can change over time , but your why makes you show up every day .
As Simon Sinek has been teaching the world , people do not buy what you do .
Why Matters are to create global content automatically , or to focus on excellent quality or to focus on the excellent quality content .
I CEO of Content and CEO , lays out three key reasons .
The foundation is the foundation for content .
Believe it has a multi-year , inspire it .
A common vision , however , it is different for a long time .
It is necessary .
It is possible that an long-term investment and requires long-term focus .
It can drives clarity and motivation .
Just to this as the Celery Test .
Why will attract people and make your decisions clear ?
In fact , with a reason `` Why clearly ? '' with a reason in an effort , anyone within the organization can make a decision as well and as accurately as possible .
The stronger and more clear you need influence the business and the situation will happen .
How do you spend some focused time answering the following questions ?
Do not hesitate to approach this as a thing thinking , exercise , jotting . What comes to mind as you think about each question ?
Then , look for common , currently to understand on your why .
Why does your problem exist ?
Why are you the way that you are ?
Where do you want your organization to be in three years ?
Where do you want your content to be in three years ?
Why does your company do what it does ?
How does your content fit fit in the vision of vision ?
What do you do better than anyone else ?
What do people expect from you and your team ?
What key successes have you had ?
What made them successful ?
What key failures has you ?
What made them less than successful ?
What would you like to have the same with regard to regard to the content of the content ?
What would you like to change ?
What is your problem Test ? How do you make and measure content decisions ?
You may find that the answers vary .
Take a step back and view it all as your vision for the future .
What if it is possible ?
I can have many teams .
If you find that other teams , have Whys with yours , use those discoveries to engage in conversation in conversation .
Find out about the other person 's reasons .
Listen with the intent to understand , not to refute .
For example , at one company . We have a very strong , why to improve time to market and costs of costs .
To complete the task , they needed good quality content .
Even though their own content meant to be around quality quality – to content .
The content that met is what did not meet theirs .
By doing a study , the linguists , were able to demonstrate that content for machine translation for machine translation , also was less accurate .
The students were better able to engage and support each other .
By a way , how can you be perceived as a way to converse with the world by Adam Grant and was reminded of their vision of ten ?
Why do leaders leaders ?
They assume that people have it .
They might have at one point .
People forget .
When the effort gets to the How gets `` fuzzy '' .
The lyrics are as follows : `` We must continue to communicate about the vision , so it can motivate , and let us know and let us know we are on the right track '' .
It was one of the first change , but the hard way is to do it because people got it at one time , that they continue to do so .
When communicating , you should ensure that you are experiencing front of the right people you desire on front of the right people .
Who would you like to do ?
Who need to make decisions about your project ?
Who should carry out the plan ?
Who has a lot of influence in the mind ?
Think up and down .
How can I learn more about the question ? If you have not watched Simon , it is just talk on how great leaders and a humble affair with flip charts .
His talk has become one of the top five , it talks of all time .
What is your content ? Why ?
It is not a matter of whether or not the expectations of the next article is the best ; you should stay tuned for it .
I wonder why Idoura is Idoura , ACC , started using Acrolinx in 2005 .

We do n't know about you , but we are pretty excited that tomorrow is the first day of the 2016 .
For 17 days , all eyes will be on Rio days , watching more than athletes from over 200 different countries .
Regardless of whether it 's track and field , swimming , gymnastics , golf , golf , or any other competition that you have got you fired , and sportsmanship ethic sportsmanship to their respective .
We thought about that , we got to wondering what similarities might be between a gold medal and trying to create amazing content .
In addition , training is a bit more athlete . It can require more blood . I can require more blood , and tears , and tears than creating successful content .
Just consider these points as a examples , it is essential .
It can be hard to spend many years and tens of thousands of hours .
They train relentlessly in an effort to be the very best .
In fact , according to one , the average British British Olympian , spends six hours a week , and twelve days a week .
If you want to be a successful writer , you must be equally dedicated to your craft .
The more you practice and the harder you work at it , the better that you 'll achieve .
I believe matters .
I believe your success often affects on your ability to do things time and time again .
Whether or not it is hitting a arrow , positioning is an arrow in just the right way .
It is no different with writing .
Your content not only needs to be accurate , it is accurate as well .
If it is not , you risk losing your credibility .
I believe it is critical .
If you are not able to perform consistently , as an athlete , you win or lose might be a matter of luck .
That is why you must be able to deliver no problems , even when you are under extreme pressure .
When it comes to writing , it is important for a different reason .
If your content is not consistent , it can confuse your audience and even degrade your brand .
That blog can make it sound like your company is n't aligned and like you are not aligned and like you .
I believe .
Behind every great athlete stands for a fantastic coach who is there or her true potential .
It is difficult for the errors that the athlete is making , but also provide the feedback that they need to improve .
Some writers often need to help them meet their full potential .
Sometimes the best thing is for writers , but sometimes it is rather software , rather software such as Acrolinx .
Actually , in fact , with Acrolinx with working with you in your favorite authoring you create a pro writer over your shoulder helping you create the best copy .
It will be interesting to see what the next thing is weeks .
As you sit back and watch the `` Games '' , let yourself feel inspired by the athlete 's amazing self .
Remember , with some hard work and persistence ( and maybe a little help from us ) , it will not be long until your content is worthy of gold medal too .
If you are the head of marketing then you probably can view yourself as a thing .
That is what 93 percent of the CMOs percent of the CMOs we talked to as part of a recent , managing , and measuring the measuring of content .
The reason for this is that content 's business for growing your business .
The band , The other things , it is what you rely on to help and differentiate from your brand and increase sales .
The problem is that at large capacity , allow us to check at $ 500 million dollars or more ) , there tend to be a lot of people creating content .
In fact , according to our research , at that size companies have an average of 150 content creators , many of them do not report into marketing .
We are talking about the folks in product , customer services , and training , but among other areas , I am not sure who to be able to mention .
I prefer to stay on top of that much content across content .
When you have to localize all of that content for different audiences .
That is why if you are the head of marketing , you have really to be focused on content governance .
It is the only way to help you bring order to what you 're doing while you consistently create successful , high-impact .
I Systems , and Systems and People : The Path States is responsible for governing .
It does through a combination of laws , legislation , and executive orders to balance each other out .
While they do n't give the government complete control , they do help create order .
When it comes to content , it is a similar story . It is a similar story .
After all , just because you are the head of marketing , that does not mean that you are supposed to be a dictator .
Having said that , what you can do is put a framework in place that gives you key points of control and compliance .
I can consist of a combination of structures , systems , and others .
Let 's take a closer look at each puzzle .
Just as you can not build a house without a house , you can not manage all of your company 's content without plan .
This plan needs to encompass several structures , including a content architecture , universal targeting , and content performance .
The sales of these things : having these structures in place will help you understand that your content can be found for specific things . That 's your content points .
They also help to understand that your content is breaking down big , why can be repackaged and repurposed and repurposed .
Even technology is not the end of the day , we are still a ways to play great content for us .
The first thing is that it can help , but it can not be , that the dozens or hundreds of people who are involved in your content efforts can work faster and more .
The other big value that technology provides that it helps you to facilitate , so that is a seamless process .
All of this and more , you look at content marketing now , and automation , automation .
There are tools that will help you manage your content , distribute your content , and improve the quality of Acrolinx .
If you take a look at newspapers or magazines , they tend to have hundreds of writers who report up into a much smaller team .
Those the editors manage assignments , ensure quality control , although quality control , and help keep the content machine .
Marketing executives are adopting a similar approach .
They often put one person in charge of content , tools , measurement , etc .
On the other side of the house , they typically install an Guess who is responsible for overseeing .
I know about the people who contribute about your content , and how to organize them .
The Way Forward Forward is a large and important job .
It takes a lot of upfront , but once you have done that work it will pay understand for a long time to come .
There is no one silver bullet for getting content , governance you 've got to use the appropriate combination of structures , systems , and people for your business .
I automate , the idea is to systematize , streamline and automate as much faster process for everyone .

In my opinion , the world , the manufacturing industry is unnecessary to a variety of factors , such as due to a variety of factors , such as the challenges of attracting and challenges .
It is possible to keep the biggest drivers in technology .
There are many ways to assist to make today 's work faster than more .
Taking under consideration that the impact of the answers may be having as an example .
It is attaching to everything from machines and assembly .
For instance , they can detect when machines are not operating properly and repair them before they break down .
This gives them a difficult time to understand what is happening on the factory floor , some companies are using the IoT to optimize .
It is the sort of people who embrace it like these who are getting ahead , but themselves for long-term success .
It is from the Factory Floor ; I can not understand the value of the value for the value of both of them .
This has an important role to play in the content that they produce .
It is an area where they can use some help .
We know because earlier this year we published an edition of our conflicts Content , that was focused on manufacturing specifically on the manufacturing industry .
You can read all about what we were written by downloading the full report by downloading the full report , but here meets our minimum threshold .
Just 25.6 25.6 25.6 companies publishing .
I believe that only percent of manufacturing companies are publishing that is both content and consistent .
Besides these , I am sure these things happen from a 2016 , report from a 2016 , report from Content .
One rule is that the same report finds that only 18 percent of the old manufacturers has an idea .
In our dreams , it is necessary to take the same approach to content as they are doing .
First of all , that means being strategic .
The content is distributed in a strategy strategy because it helps to successful content in your mind .
In addition , your progress and results is your progress and results in an effective way to guarantee your long-term success .
I believe manufacturers should also be embracing the right technology for their content .
With a content , it is platform optimization , for example , it 's easier to create amazing content and consistent at scale .
Having great content is no longer a nice to have , but rather a business , that is essential .
The Future is Technology . If you are in the manufacturing industry , you have probably seen a lot of changes over the years .
While technology is driving behind many changes , it is up to you to ensure that it is not the factories that reap .
I believe actually resonates across your organization , can also take advantage of such a content faster and easier .
Labor Day weekend is only around the corner .
However , I am sad to say goodbye to beach weather , and backyard barbeques about the holiday .
After all , if your job involves content content you probably will work hard .
Are you not just as entitled as anyone to a day off to kick back and relax ?
In fully , appreciate how deserving you are a carefree day out of the office , just think about what having a job that revolves around content would have looked like 30 or 40 years ago .
You might have been a writer or editor , a graphic designer , or an editor in this era .
And while the fundamental of that work would have still been planning for and creating content , the fact is that these days , having a job in content is a much more complicated and more complicated .
That is because today is content to bring a whole new host of skills and areas of expertise .
More often than they are not just writers or editors .
Sometimes it 's exciting and lets face facts .
Even though fashion , today 's What They Take over being able to write content that 's coherent , and having an eye for grammar , punctuation .
For example , think they need to .
There are still plenty of ways to work to be done , but today is content .
Depending on the content , they need to think about what content they are creating , and how to use it to help .
If content is not strategic , it is not effective .
Just be sure to using a variety of things .
Gone are the days when I am thinking meant to use knowing how to use it .
At last count , there were more than 3,800 , many of which are specific creation , distribution , and measurement .
Knowing that this is important to being effective on the job .
If you are dumb about technology , you will struggle in any content job .
Create content that serves that serves as the serves .
It must be key messages , in addition to key messages .
For example , it needs to be optimized .
It should require the link to be more important to be more important than to be able to maintain engagement engagement .
It should be hard to complete a action such as most of all . It needs to complete a action such as another piece of content or signing up for a free trial .
That is a lot more to think about than just whether or not just your content looks good .
Create many different types of content .
You need to communicate with your target in lots of different ways .
That means that you need to be at nuances of different types of content .
In order to write a killer post lines , you can write a killer post lines .
You have also got to make all of these different types of content , such as make all these different content .
I can content through many more channels .
It 's literally hundreds of different paid , owned and earned channels that you have to consider .
If you work at a large capacity , you may have the luxury of letting someone worry about this for you .
In many cases , particularly at smaller companies , you are on the hook for this as well .
I believe in a much more crowded situation .
With content playing such a important role in attracting content , nurturing , and creating a lot more of it .
The world is incredibly difficult , which means with content is incredibly difficult .
Your content has to be original , interesting , useful , engaging in polite and engaging in sexual acts .
Moreover , it does n't matter .
The long after a piece of content is created and published , published and published , content , content , and how to further improve improve improve .
Thanks to the rise of it , you can no longer rely on gut instincts and decisions .
You have to demonstrate that real emotion based on hard data .
I hope you get the idea that this list could go on .
Being a content professional is a fast-paced and exciting job that demands a lot .
It is a wonderful type of work to pursue , but it is also challenging .
So , this year , sit back , relax , and take a moment to appreciate everything that you and your peers are .
On behalf of everyone here , I make my hat to you .
One of the tricky things about creating content for a global audience is that you often have to do so .
Many companies we work with here at Acrolinx . For example , translate their content into 30 languages or more .
That is a huge difference . One that comes at a high cost .
Using a translation is incorrect , and it can be very well taken .
Take the example of Kentucky Fried Fried ' trouble in China a few years ago .
The problem was that the company had translated , it was famous , tagline , `` Why good ? ''
That can not have done much good things for your partners .
I believe that there is the case reported in a recent article on your planet article about a translation mix-up .
It was the translation of the word , `` Are you referring to the doctors of one male patient to believe that he was suffering from food ? `` .
I understand , but not all bad ; it has such a consequences .
At fact , they are just happy accidents that at the worst time leave you scratching your head .
We have picked some of our favorite , but it is examples of translations here .
I believe it can say there are more to share in this post .
If you are curious about some of the others , a quick Google search might leave you or deeply offended .
We will leave that up to you .
In the meantime , here are some more nice examples of just can not turn out right .
I do not have the same ring as I can not Believe it , but it is definitely more entertaining .
We do n't know if this is a translation fail . Otherwise , the sweetest thing ever !
If you ever see this sign , we suggest that you turn around and run away as fast as you can .
This one is only funny when you learn that the original Hindi lyric was , you 're one in a million .
We are not sure what these people are attempting to say , but it is a great message .
They were very close with this one , but did not get it right .
We love this .
If you have to do it , you may as well be careful about it .
We are not sure if this is a translation error or just a problem , but it is just not good .
It is definitely something to be concerned about .
We hope these translation will help you find a laugh and reminded you of one of one of translation .
You can be sure to make sure that they make sense , but you always need a native native native .
The biggest challenges in this instance is producing content .
It is not just any content , but content that produces results .
That means it is not a case but it can be the right prospect , for the right prospect , for the right reason at the right time , in the right time , in the right time , in the right time .
I believe with appeal .
It converts , that converts , regardless of where prospects and interact with it .
How can we overcome this challenge ?
One of the best ways to ask for advice from others .
It departmental silos from discovering us useful .
But , it does not have to be this way .
There are many lessons to be learned from other communication professionals , regardless of where they work inside an understand .
The recent article is `` The Why Behind the How Behind the How Behind the How Behind the How Behind the Way '' .
If you find that other teams , have whys with yours , use those discoveries to engage in conversation in conversation .
Find out the other person 's reasons .
Listen with the intent to understand , not to refute .
I decades to Approach to Producing , but Content folks who document how products and services have overcome several services .
They 've invented , tested , and successfully implemented techniques that marketers should consider .
I do n't believe for example .
It is a method of repurposing across multiple channels and output it output .
Harvey writers in companies that use a single-source produce more deliverables , and with less effort than those who use traditional desktop .
I multi-channel , multi-channel , publishing publishing technical writers , documents that documents to the audience .
I believe relies on the creation of discrete and I intentionally designed for reuse .
Each content of content has a specific label ( e.g. , procedure . I am uncertain value . )
Borrow writers create content models , which content can be used to pull the right pieces of content automatically .
I understand who adopt this approach produce produce produce , without paying associated with traditional opinions and techniques .
Also , they can publish to multiple output formats because the content — and it is stored separately .
It critical difference , the efficient difference is the efficient content producers from us .
It is part of what makes writers more adept at creating increasing of relevant content .
Managing Tone , Himesh , Metal , and I am not able to discuss the subject of content to discuss the subject .
The wrong difficulties , maintenance in product assembly , maintenance , or repair instructions .
That is why technical communication teams to Rockwell , Automation .
It is rules in companies that their content as a business as a business asset their content as a business follows .
So simultaneously , has helped them realize it is n't true sometimes , think faster time to market — while simultaneously .
Rubbing writers that use tools such as , `` I Acrolinx toward producing producing content with the right tone of voice , branding , and writing rules . ''
If you are a content marketer , you know how important content is to the success of your business .
After all , catching those are impacted your mistakes mistakes .
In the latest research report , `` Good ! How to Double Movie report , `` How to Double Movie of Your Impact of Your Impact Content and proves the connection between Your Impact of Your Content . ''
Do Benefit to Benefit and Benefit at Their 's connections ?
The connections are crystal clear to those who study online , it is behavior .
I can not shop for information to answer questions or services to answer questions about products .
Search engines such as Google serve to these online answers , not based on which department .
Marketing content is competing with attention for attention .
So , why not align all content , produce it in the same manner and control it using the same rules and tools ?
I believe Experiences is Easy to Craft . Make it a group to gain from their technical writer , marketers , and editorial .
I was sitting in Cleveland Hopkins International International , when I began to pen this blog before a flight of a week .
If you have ever been to Content Marketing World , then you know what I mean .
It is four days of nonstop , but I can head-spinning it .
There were 4,000 attendees 225 and more going on than anyone could possibly take in .
It really missed the new ideas that any attendee who is not brimming .
I once again again , the Acrolinx was well well at the conference , as one of the exhibitors .
I can honestly say that we were the talk of Content because of what we gave away .
People were literally staring at our booth , talking about us everywhere , and vying about their chance to win .
Is there any explaination to what it is possible for prize to have everyone whipped up into a content marketing ?
Believe it or not , it was selfie .
I am not familiar with that .
Most people have not .
As it turns out , thank you for the recent advances in toasting .
It is not everyone wants to jam and jam their own face in the morning , but you 'd be surprised at just how popular these people are .
I can understand that you might be thinking that a random random prize to offer at a content marketing marketing may be useful .
If you think about it , you can see where we were coming from .
There really are parallels between it , toasters marketing and content marketing .
Here are a few examples of what I mean ; it is essential .
In content marketing , you can not just set it and forget it .
Yes , you want to build up , competencies and play to your strengths , but over and expect to get great results .
Likewise , although we mastered making toast a long time ago , it took a clever twist to create a new product .
The lesson is to always look for creative ways to add a new ways to add to your content .
The small changes can have a big impact .
I believe it is key .
Offer a person something generic and you will be lucky to get their attention .
Offer them something that is truly personalized for them , and you will have them in your hands .
If we have been it , it faces smiley faces faces into your bread , I do n't think anyone would have thought twice about it .
However , because this particular particular occurrence can not occur you toast into your own face , it is quite simple .
It is the same with content .
If you want it to resonate and draw people in , it 's got to be as possible .
I believe matters .
If you want your toast to look like you , the heating is configured in just the right way .
If any one is out of it , you will just wind up with a burnt mess .
The content of content is equally important .
That is true on all levels , but particularly when it comes to your writing .
If it has tried typos or other words and phrases that are important to your brand , that 's a real problem .
Even though worse toast , however , what you wind up with is burnt .
I believe it is critical .
If you are the proud owner of a selfie , you can submit a picture of yourself to the manufacturer .
You can submit another picture if you are not happy with the plate .
The truth is that most often people do not get things right on their first try .
You have to iterate and refine everything that you do to the best possible outcome .
That is certainly true when it comes to content .
I have written , read , and rewritten of this post a handful of times now .
I hope you enjoy it .
Friends , I am officially officially after my time in Cleveland at Content .
If you have not been to the extent yourself , I would definitely recommend it .
It is an informative and entertaining event .
And it goes without saying , `` That the next time you eat a piece of toast , you should give some thought to improve your own content marketing . ''
The future may be artificial intelligence .
Before we 've been , it might be helpful to look back at where we 've been .
In my mind , let me give you a short history lesson about how we use to create evolved over time .
I promise to keep it brief .
If we look way in time , it is possible to writing it , but it is emerged around 4000 BC or bone into implements .
It is about a thousand years later in the they started using thin reed , brushes .
By 600 AD , we find the Europeans using quills and record their ideas .
That practice fell out of favor by the 18th and 19th as well , but thanks to the invention of pencils .
By the way , along with the first commercially successful successful successful typewriter , which is reigned by the personal computer .
That is enough history for one post .
It can be said that as I write these words on my laptop , I can appreciate how it comes to the tools with which we write .
In my opinion , we can all agree that typing words onto a screen — and being able to change them .
As I 'm not currently having , hands and pages are full of scribbles and the reality is that most of the advances we have n't changed .
After all , no matter whether I am using a pen or a MacBook , I can labor-intensive process and labor-intensive .
The good news is that it may not always have to be .
When can intelligence joke not certainly is n't new ?
In fact , it got it back in 1950 when Alan Turing .
And while artificial intelligence made some important advances in those early days , it came to unlock more of the unlock more .
I am forward to Fast forward to present day , and artificial intelligence is being used in many different kinds of business . I -winning as much .
The bands The many applications are content and optimization .
Let 's take a closer look at each other .
Natural Language , Some companies use artificial language generation to drive natural language , although a process allows them to generate content .
For example , they may use NLG to turn financial results in text-based .
When the underlying artificial intelligence may seem sophisticated , the result is natural .
For companies looking to save time and money , that can be a welcome change .
Although NLG technologies the point where they can create great content that is n't data .
While I doubt that human writers will ever go away , it is nice to know that at least some content can be automated .
I believe it can also be used to help after your content is created to help you make it as effective as possible .
Content is optimization like software intelligence to read and analyze .
While this does n't make creating the content any easier , it does help ensure your content is aligned with your brand standards .
In any case , it means that anyone in your mind can write effective content , even if that is not a skill that comes to them naturally .
Where to From Here ?
While it is unclear where artificial intelligence will take us in the months and years , be sure that it 's creating huge opportunities to help you with your content .
Whether it 's original content for you , or helping you optimize , the fact is that artificial intelligence is going to help companies at scale .
It may not be long when writing our own content on computers seems as though writing with a typewriter .
People have opinions about everything — is no exception .
They have views on how important it is , how important it should sound , and how it should sound .
Not all people are entitled to their opinion or even experience .
Think about content tend to spread and , opinions about content tend to start hold .
I 'm going to set the record straight about four content so I think that I need to be cleared .
Short is always better .
We live in the age of the sound bite , where content is constantly being packaged .
It 's a time when we 're constantly reminded that we need to cater to shrinking characters , spans and expressing yourself in the city .
To make no mistake about it , I believe it is great .
It is quick and simple to consume , which is critical for today 's purpose .
However , that does not automatically make long-form long-form .
People still want it , but it can content that they can sink their teeth into .
Look at the success of sites such as Medium , which has built ; built on the depth and quality quality articles on the depth and long articles .
In fact , according to Medium to Medium is the equivalent of about 1,600 .
The next time you think shorter is better , just remember that is not always the case .
I certainly has the place of everything else , but not to the exclusion of everything else .
Sometimes you need to go to deep and demonstrate , even if you means keeping your reader 's attention for more than just a minute or two .
I believe , however fun are mutually exclusive .
I hear people say it all the time .
Since they are writing for lawyers , or bankers , or either doctors , they do not think they can make their content any fun .
Instead , in their mind , it is got to be formal and by the book or it just wo n't be as professional .
However , there is no doubt that your content needs to be appropriate for the audience you are targeting and do n't forget that it 's entirely possible to read , without sacrificing without sacrificing .
Remember , your readers are people .
It does not matter what industry they are in or what their job title is , they will typically respond just as well as anyone else or not .
I believe there is a time and place for everything .
I am not saying that you start laughing jokes in your company 's annual report .
What I am thinking is that it is okay to break down some of the barriers and start talking to your audience rather than at them .
Never give away the secret .
Some people are reluctant to share any meaningful knowledge or expertise in their content .
They are afraid that if they do , they will be giving away their company 's secret sauce for free .
By the way , this is a topic that Marcus Sheridan from at length .
The reality is that ever since the invention of the Internet has access to many different information .
This has a strong amount of importance .
The first time is that to get people 's attention easily , you have to make great information easily .
The second is that if you do not , then they will not hesitate to find someone else who will .
The bottom line is that you need to create really useful , valuable content .
It means giving away some of your company 's secret .
That is not something that you should be afraid of .
The truth is that if you think that you are not need you anymore , because of what you 've written in one blog , then you have got bigger problems .
It is better to publish something than nothing .
Some people have this in their mind that it is better to get a piece of content than it is to wait to get it right .
As a result , they might be willing to compromise on quality , letting errors of fact , and other careless people may stay into their writing .
They do well with the belief that their audience will be forgiving .
So the content is n't perfect , they think , but it 's close enough . Let 's just get it out there .
The problem is that people do take note of imperfections , regardless of their size .
As we have written about before , there is no such thing as neutral .
Everything you publish is going to impact your brand in one of two ways .
It is going to help , or it will help you .
Take care and remember that quality quality is most important to your content .
Of course , other content can be done there .
I will try to address more of them in a follow-up post .
What pops into your head when you think of quality ?
In my opinion , Swiss watches .
German automobiles ?
Which Japanese manufacturing processes ?
I believe such as the American Society for the quality of quality quality .
Is it a statement of excellence ?
Does it reflect satisfaction , satisfaction ?
Is it more about how well something works ?
How good looks look ?
Whether it is free of already ?
It is the quality of the quality to the same questions .
One of the most enjoyable , though collections of content is Heidi Cohen .
I define their content content greatly , Heidi asked 25 of the top content .
After years in the content field , I have learned to look at content at two different perspectives and the provider of content .
It has a job to do — , not just for the provider as well .
To the purists , I would say that acknowledging is not selling out .
I believe whether the content was the content of the content .
Are they able to get an answer to their question and complete their task ?
I can easily find the content if the content is content succeeded .
Did they read the content ?
Do they trust it ?
Did they take an action prompted by the content ?
What are the bounce ?
Did they engage in the content , share the content ?
Does the content reflect the brand ?
You can the content be easily translated .
With that , let us take a step back .
Consider criteria for content that will succeed for both of you .
Things still matter , sometimes the original content criteria criteria are still matter .
Do not build trust , or help , but does not build trust .
It is like to pay attention to the grammar such as grammar .
I believe matters .
Create that is clear . Easy to understand . Use and reuse .
I believe it matter .
Are you trying to drive leads , enjoys , or sales ?
Make your content work for you by creating content that reflects your brand and voice .
Try to use the terminology that you reinforces .
It is very tempting to add hygiene , as it is setting quality quality to create hygiene .
The challenge in this area is that you can end up with meandering of rules , and do not reflect the need to serve your users .
Use it to drive your decisions about what you need .
That will inform you of how you develop content .
I guarantee the spotlight will shine on you .
You are probably wondering . How much quality is enough quality quality ?
Am I spinning it for perfection ?
Is it good enough for a certain amount of time ?
With many business decisions , there 's a point of can returns .
You can determine what the quality is , if you establish your quality yourself by testing your content , or checking industry standards .
We found that once in my previous life , we found that once about 80 % on our Acrolinx , our results were n't continue to improve the extra 20 % .
I know your content . Why helps the decision around what level of quality is appropriate ?
You should stay tuned for any new article , making the water From Developing .
I wonder why Idoura is Idoura , ACC , started using Acrolinx in 2005 .
It Alexia to coaching after a thirteen year old year old career , but high-tech career runs her own global .
Just a coaching mindset with consulting results .
I believe it is n't a problem .
He is a skill that you develop over his own time .
The more you do it , the easier it becomes to create great messages , that conveys your key messages .
There is certainly no substitute for gaining that experience , but there is something to be said for learning from practices .
That is why we have compiled a list of writing tips that we believe can help you become a more effective writer and make the most of your content .
They are the rules , and it is possible that we try to follow at Acrolinx and we would encourage you to do the same .
To make them easier , we have broken up our writing tips into three categories : the stuff you need to be thinking about before you are done writing .
The answer is Happy reading .
Keep speaking in public until You get started first .
I would like to have a clear mission .
You should always have a good sense of what you are trying to achieve with a particular piece of content before you write it .
If that sounds obvious to you , it should .
Even though we all know this , we do n't always do it and the writing process can wind up taking a lot longer as a result longer .
It is possible that you may not have all of the details that worked out upfront , make sure you and your any other agreed .
I suggest you know your audience .
Make sure that you understand who you are writing for .
This may seem like a certain thing , but it does not always happen .
To create good content , you need to know who your audience is and understanding and understanding their topic .
It is only when you have this frame of reference that you can create content with the people you 're writing it for .
Take some time to understand what happened .
As a writer , you might find yourself writing about topics that you may not find an expert on .
In cases , you may rely on the topic . You may rely on interviews , and your own independent research to repair .
You might also find yourself writing as you learn .
After that , it may be necessary to meet a deadline . It is less ideal .
That is because you may find yourself having to rework over and over as you learn new information .
For that reason , whenever possible , digest is all of the information available to you first .
I believe it is an issue .
It does not matter whether you are writing a blog post or a white blog , it 's always helpful to organize your ideas with an outline .
If you are not sure of shorter bullets , you are outline .
For long-form , it may spread across many pages .
Either way , creating a outline is a useful exercise because it forces you to write .
Doing so will save you time and energy on the long run .
Who keywords to use ?
If you want to optimize about your content for search , it is good to know what keywords you are going to target .
Yes , you can always retrofit them in after the fact , but it 's easier to work them into your copy in a natural way .
Do you need help picking keywords ?
I suggest you check out this great resource from a certain resource .
Keep `` These spoken in peace , '' in response , `` You 're Writing Six . ''
Your audience will not include your audience .
It may be writing 101 , but it bears repeating it .
Your choice is of no concern .
The first person from the third person is much more engaging than the third person .
It is more immediate and positions you are as a group of people , while the third person is more accurate .
Likewise , address your audience using the second person , you '' rather than the third person to make your writing more engaging and personable .
Be polite and honest .
Along with the same lines , try to make sure you write similar people .
That does not mean that everything we say is ready , or appropriate , for print , but rather that it 's becoming important to avoid formal corporate speak .
A more casual and smart tone will be more effective at your readers .
If done well , it will not lose any of the things you may be trying to project .
You are your sentence .
Lots of long sentences in a row can be tedious to read .
Too many short sentences back to back can be jarring .
You should make sure that you use a combination of both to create content with a cadence and enjoyable to read .
You should show your personality .
It is okay to be funny , witty , and charming , or anything else that reflects your personality .
It is not that , doing so will help you to your audience .
Keep in mind that audience is what you are doing .
You can then dial your content 's personality up or down to fit the circumstances .
I believe the dots .
Sometimes writers make the audience assumption that their audience is similar to themselves .
It is worse to think that their audience is made up of mind readers .
As a result , they write in the equivalent of shorthand , perhaps using concepts , perhaps that not everyone in their target audience will understand .
They list out a bunch of ideas without explaining how they all fit together .
Reading your content should not be a chore , so make sure you connect and explanation for anyone to follow it .
Tell a story .
One of the most effective ways to engage audiences is by telling them a story .
That 's not going to be possible for every thing you create , but whenever you can tell a story , it helps to get them hooked into your content .
Why do you put the why before ?
I can not recall the writers who work for them and how they work for it .
They often do not spend enough time talking about why they do what they do .
That is really critical of the puzzle of the puzzle that you create .
It is also something we have written about in the past , so check out this post to learn more .
You can break some rules .
I would like to , is important .
Also you definitely want to ensure that your content is well written , that does n't mean that you need to adhere to every single grammar ever written .
Sometimes , it is okay to break certain rules to make your content more conversational .
For example , it is okay to start your sentences with a conjunction , and or , but , or or , etc .
To end them with a preposition and to end them with a preposition .
Keep speaking in public Before You Publish .
Read it out loud .
This is such a basic , but also important , step .
Reading your content out loud forces you to pay attention to every word you have written .
In the process you will catch mistakes , awkward turns of phrase , and other issues that you might have otherwise missed .
I believe redundancies is in the situation .
It can be useful to highlight key messages in your writing more than once to help their content .
I over Cast a careful eye over your content to make sure that you are not just saying the same things over and over again .
If you have made the point once , in most cases , there is no need to make it a second or third time .
You need to get rid of any extra spaces .
Are you still using two spaces after you have periods ?
This is so 20th century .
In reality , that practice fell out of favor when we entered the digital world .
If you do not take those spaces out , there are any graphic designer laying your content out .
You can read more about it here .
Tell fewer words .
Be efficient and concise with your use of words is difficult and takes a lot more work .
Once your content is in place , make sure to go back and give it a critical edit .
Try to tighten your prose , and eliminate unnecessary words .
This will make your content clearer , and more to the point .
I am certain to other content .
You need to make the content of your content and more useful , go back and insert your links to other content .
For example , you might link to the link to the bios of people you reference , to articles a particular concept in more depth or to other resources .
Just make sure that anything you link to is high quality .
Doing not only makes your content better , it makes it more attractive to search engines .
Make sure it is scannable .
You are giving your content a final review . Look for opportunities to break it up visually .
For example , you might want to add more headings , use bulleted , or insert callouts or graphics .
In a world where people are time , poor blocks of content can be daunting and turn readers off .
By giving people different reference points , they can quickly quickly navigate to the parts that interest you .
Give credit where credit is due .
We all tend to consult various sources such as the writing process .
And , while it is fine , the earth is fine . The earth is round . The sky is round , the sky is blue without attributing , and endnote .
Thank you for reading our list of writing tips .
We hope you find them useful as you get ready to work on your next piece of content .
I am in it hundred and it can be Columbus in the ocean blue blue .
Remember to learn that in school ?
As children we were wondering the basics about Christopher Columbus ' epic journey to discover the New World .
It 's hard for us to attempt to attempt education with some interesting facts of Columbus , we may have some interesting facts of Columbus , or even his journey journey .
Along with his brother Bartolomeo , Columbus operated a little mapmaking and bookselling .
If there is no other reason because this is noteworthy as much as we do .
The following : `` Source '' before becoming a famous , admiral and governor of the New World , Columbus was a pirate , or privateer .
In the meantime , the following : laid in popular belief , in popular belief , most educated Europeans in Columbus ' day understood that the world was round , but they did not yet know the world .

( The following : 'We are sharing these facts with you to honor a very important world , if somewhat , who forever who changed the world .
As a content professional , no matter whether you have the day off or are hard at work , in our view it is worth taking a step back and trying to apply a few lessons from Christopher Columbus 's work .
Those lessons do not be afraid to chart your own course .
You have to take risks and take risks .
It may not always work out , but it is only by taking risks that you get any rewards .
Columbus saw opportunities where other people did not and pursuing those opportunities .
Trust yourself .
On his maiden , voyage is to the New World , Columbus ' crew threatened to mutiny and return to Europe .
If you are believed that is ahead of pressure like a like a like king and something that give into the pressure .
It is the same in life .
You should trust your instincts .
Never give up .
I am not sure sunk under Columbus ' ships in Columbus .
While that is definitely tragic , you have to admire the man 's thoughts and can .
Those are two qualities that content always need to have .
I 've got to make sure you always keep at it because the content game is a marathon and 've got to make sure you always keep at it .
We hope you enjoyed our Columbus Day post .
Keep up the hard work creating amazing content , and we will try to do the same .
The truth about content is that it is a messy business .
Take a look at 10 different content and I am sure you will find ten different styles of writing .
Basically , the differences will be pretty small .
The usage of usage varies among the group or one person has a hard time . Why does anyone do this ?
In other cases , the differences in writing styles will be much more pronounced , in fact , that you might be able to tell who the author is written .
To begin with , imagine working for a company where there are hundreds of people creating content .
Keep in mind that most of them are not professional writers .
Most likely they are sales , customer service , or product people , such as time to be responsible for creating customer-facing from time to time .
Can you imagine how different the style of all of that content ?
Do not forget that people often use different words to say the same thing .
Take three different writers . They may all have their own way of explaining a company 's products and services .
They might even use slightly different names for them . The ones they have been taught within their department , but that are not necessarily right .
`` Welcome to Content '' is the Wild West At many companies , content is effectively challenging .
Yes , there may be some sure in place for people to follow , but chances are that nobody outside of the department that created them actually does .
There is so much content being created to police it all .
I can only do so much , so there is only plenty of plenty to do and do it into customers .
That is actually a much bigger problem than most people realize .
When a company publishes that sounds like it is being written by lots of different people , and when the quality of that content varies , it can be changed .
I believe it is most companies main touch point with their customers .
If the content is inconsistent , it makes it seem as though it makes it seem as though the company is not speaking with one voice .
It gives the impression that the company has a split personality because it sounds one way and another way .
In addition , if all is describing the same thing in different ways , or using slightly different words .
It can be of your brand .
Let 's face it , confusing is not a good idea .
Neither is it sloppy or all over the shop ?
When a company publishes that reflects a lot of writing , use of terms , and overall ability , it sends a negative message to customers .
I can content at many companies to the Wild West .
When it comes to anything , the result can be chaotic and dangerous .
It is not a good approach , but it is not a good approach .
It is the New States in Town , when it 's great for individual writers to have their own style and voice , they all need to write the same way .
You need it to happen .
I can come in many different forms .
It can be a style guide like I mentioned earlier or a team of `` editors '' .
Even though this works well at small , the problem is that it just does not scale .
It is possible that most people do not consult style , but it is common sense .
Or , if they do , it is their own department , rather than one that is intended for the entire issue .
And while editors can play a role at mitigating these issues , you would need an army of them to churn .
It is not a very cost-effective , it is not a very cost-effective .
A better solution is to use technology .
It is not checks for software , for example , not only checks and spelling .
Everything also depends on your company 's unique style , guidelines , and ensures that and phrases .
And since this works right in the authoring tools that people actually use , check out Google Docs , and Microsoft among others .
In addition , it is scores your content , which makes it your standards a breeze .
All you have to do is tell people that their content will not be published or distributed unless it meets a certain score .
And instant instant .
Be a little bit of the important art .
It does n't have to be that way while things can easily get messy .
It is a like to living a like a king and a like king to your company .
If you are a small organization , style , and a few crack editors , may do the trick .
If you are a large level , however , you might want to consider something a little more powerful .
Believe it , it is the summation of your personal nature with a company across every conceivable .
It is the feeling you walk away with , after you are your way through a company 's website , or after interacting with a member of it .
It 's the impression that you get after seeing it ; it 's advertisements , using the services of products , and your feelings with it reps. .
They help to shape you opinion about the company and play a big role in whether you would build a lasting relationship with that company .
It 's not surprisingly surprisingly , customer experiences have to be carefully managed to exercise and believe .
It is about putting your thoughts first in every stage of their journey with you .
The price of their products are able to turn the experiences that they create for their target audiences and converting their target audiences of their target audiences .
In the meantime , the companies that do not are at risk .
By the album , Some Facts Facts About Customer , and have to help the following statistics are willing to pay more for a better customer experience .
In my opinion , only one percent of it can feel that their expectations are always met .
In the meantime , the following are : Oracle , Maximizing with satisfaction with customer , journeys by 15 percent , while reducing the costs of serving percent .
In the meantime , McKinsey is 89 percent of customers to customers a company because of a poor customer experience .
In the meantime , the following : What is more ? What 's more , according to Gartner , by 2017 percent of consumer .
The question , however , is it two-pronged , and what does that actually mean , and how do you go about creating better customer experiences ?
It can be difficult to Take Shape in The fact that customer experience can be influenced by virtually any interaction , you can understand .
On the highest level , what it means is that you have to .
There are many things between the things that are discovering between you and how you are and how you can help them a particular problem .
It is important to map out what each of the steps on the journey is that you can identify customer experiences .
In the process , you should keep in mind that customer is rarely present .
You need to be sure that one step of the journey provides a positive experience of others .
I do not know all of the potential touch points .
As you consider each step , think of the customer journey . Think about the different places you are customers .
These people can be around around your website and marketing materials , including your social channels , such as events , your social channels , and events with your staff .
The list goes on .
The important thing is to know what all of those potential touch points are so that you can start paying attention to the experiences they are creating for you .
I wonder if you understand what you are thinking .
Every experience your customer has with you , should be easy , and ideally a pleasure .
The reason is that do n't meet that criteria need to be fixed .
It often means it is unnecessary to streamline steps to streamline and treating your needs .
Drive consistency .
On McKinsey , McKinsey is the single most important factor when it comes to customer satisfaction .
I believe the need for the need for customer journey , McKinsey , cites , and communication .
I can not touch your business from many different stages from the buyer journey for many different stages .
When the people are completely good , it can customer satisfaction .
There are plenty of other factors that drive customer experience . The four above are a good place to start .
So , so is one more content .
How does it matter in ?
If you are wondering why we are blogging about customer experience , because content has an important role to play in shaping .
After all , content is often a critical part of most of your customers .
If that content is not effective — in other words , if it does not communicate key messages clearly , you can clearly communicate your ability to create great customer experiences .
If your content is not consistent , it will be less effective if it does n't adopt the same words and phrases to the same words .
I have written more about this topic , rather the role of content in a blog blog .

More often than not , those people are with content .
Just think about it .
How often do you talk to a company 's sales or attend it ?
If at all , if at all .
Instead , most of the nature that we have with brands are driven by content .
We are able to use a product in our social media , such as the advertisements we read in our social media , such as the advertisements we read in our social media feeds up to use a product .
It is a lot of other factors to go into shaping and experience with brands .
It is usually front and center for a lot of it .
Let us take a closer look at what is and what it means for you .
When you are Customers . You are in Control . You are Content .
I have seen it estimates from 57 percent to 90 percent , with plenty of other sources that citing in between plenty of sources .
It does not matter what the nature of selling has changed .
The reality is that thank you to the internet , which has made huge amounts of information to everyone .
There is no longer longer in the company of company sales , because they can find it online for themselves .
Why that means that if you want to have a relationship with them , you need to content content , and plenty of it .
That is because your content is your content to understand .
It is the way that you can communicate your messages out to purchase them and take the next step to purchase .
I Content Helps Shape Customer , many of your content with your brand impact .
In other words , what you say and how you say affects your brand .
Let me give you some examples . It can make your customers feel respected .
I am not sure of the last time they have wasted enough time .
Your content can create a positive experience for your customers , and most importantly , useful .
People are rarely looking for fluff or noise . There is more than enough to get better experiences for them .
It can demonstrate that you pay attention to detail .
If you are worried about notice , it is errors , grammatical , errors of fact , or other mistakes in your content .
I misspelling here and there may seem like forgivable if you are customers those mistakes .
At a minimum , it might make them stop and ask themselves , if you are being careless with its content .
It can help you understand .
The tone of the voice you adopt in your content can lead a long way to make you feel like you are talking to them .
The right tone can convey that you understand that you are on the same page , that you 're in touch with them and their needs .
This is important because it can make you feel more engaged , while helping them to enjoy each of their goals .
I can create help .
I cited from my last post from some research and Company 's that noted that consistency is the most important driver of customer satisfaction .
One aspect of that , can you listen to communication , and the key to language and content .
It is difficult to describe the same tone of voice to describe the right words and phrases are used to describe your business .
Your content is not consistent in every touch . You can notice and trust me , it will not go down well with them .
If you take away anything after reading this post , let it be : Content has a growing and critically role in shaping .
That means that you need to be paying lots of attention to the quality and consistency .
The presidential election where content has played a bigger role than it has this year .
By thinking , tweets tweets and plagiarized speeches , viral has been at the center of this election .
In some cases , the candidates have used content to share an opinion or express their true spelling .
In other words , they have used it to rally their base or capitalize .
In the meantime , many of the observers have created fun poking fun at the history of the presidential .
It is in tension of the day that we head to the polls that we pay our respects to some more interesting year .
Enjoy !
I do not understand a website , it is a huge repository .
It depends on thousands of words about everything from policies and the platforms in office .
I believe this year , we used Acrolinx to evaluate the content in our findings .
If you want to see how Trump and Clinton are still in the race quality , check out this post .
You may be surprised by the results .
It has tweeted on Donald Trump .
I believe the course of election he 's been criticized with his enemies is because he 's been criticized with his enemies .
In the same time , he 's managed to use Twitter , Twitter .
In the meantime , Hillary Clinton has amassed since joining in 2011 .
During that time , she has it at a moment .
Unlike Donald Trump . Most of her mind appear to be sent on her behalf by staff of the exception of the exception .
To our knowledge , Texas does n't engage in Twitter .
It is a meme is a funny image , or piece of text that has a way of going on the internet .
There has been no shortage of memes during this election , including beauties .
Source : The Daily is . The Daily is unclear , but the Daily is unclear , if any , effect things like this has on the electorate .
Believe between the candidates and their surrogates , and their surrogates are given in the election .
While each one has a role to play , convincing voters .
In either case , the speeches really seemed to make the most headlines were Melania Convention .
It was followed up a couple of months later with Michelle , Obama is recent speech .
I would like Hillary Clinton throughout her campaign for being paid for speaking events with a variety of money events .
It is obvious that Political Cartoons Political cartoons date back to the 18th century .
It has not disappointed with a seemingly array of political cartoons gracing .
A couple of our favorites are : favorites , compared to , compared to other type of content that seems to have gone viral .
I believe Saturday Night Live has gotten a lot of attention over the past six weeks , however , debates is .
There are better or worse , videos like these things .
Although they are meant to entertain , it is safe to say that everyone creating content about the election has some kind of political agenda .
Saturday people take it under the impression that it is not difficult to understand who they support .
I apologize for sure but I apologize for what I mean .
If nothing else , we think all of this goes to show just how important content is in an election .
To be a successful candidate , politicians need to not master policy in building and defending their brand through their brand through content .
While not everyone will be happy with the outcome of this year , at least take it out as a winner .
Are you in marketing settings ?
Have you recently found yourself being asked to keeping churn levels ?
Which are you in a customer services or support role ?
Are you able to scores more on keeping the brand personality through keeping the brand personality through the customer personality ?
We are seeing these things ; it is happening more and more frequently .
A lot of people talk about marketing marketing , but after-sales and the internet never happened .
I am here to tell you that those days are wonderful .
Please have a Think for a second . What is marketing ?
I am not going to try to find the best possible possible possible aspect , but very hard , people would agree with your target market them and reminding your target when they forget .
Of course , that you are great and you can make their life better .
I carefully did not say telling you that , because back in the old days it would stop when someone became a customer .
That 's gone out of fashion for three very good reasons . You are your biggest source , whether you sell shoes , phones , planes , or software .
You are existing customers to buy from you than anyone else .
Many of them are on subscription .
You can now subscribe to software , razors , cars , and even a vehicle .
That means that every year or every month , or in fact every minute , you can disappear .
Sam , Walton is quote has never been more true .
The customer is the customer .
He can fire everyone in the company from the chairman , simply by spending his money elsewhere .
In the modern manner , you are target their target audience will trust you .
It is advisable to become a key goal for marketing products .
As Scott Cook has said , `` A brand is no longer what we tell the brand it is — . ''
It is a trend to move to subscription or other recurring it is a seismic .
I say `` seismic '' because that moment when marketing can pack and go home , their job well done , just disappeared .
There is no single moment of sale .
One case in point : Adobe currently has millions of trial of their software .
The role of the role of after-sales , the role of nearly a focused on a great customer experience , experience and satisfaction .
I believe tweet= has become the new issue .
At this age I am not sure customerexperience # content CX , After-sales , After-sales .
The subscription age has Led predicted complete of commitment and encourage .
Michael Brenner has cited that 73 % of people surveyed from their life .
The trend of this trend has Led Years heightened focus on the customer experience and established brands .
It 's apps for young people to have new life uncomfortable , but it is irrelevant .
The business experience is driving the business .
It is famous Jim Impossible 's famous book on company growth showed that companies .
There are many companies in which they interact with their brand .
As marketing became a numbers game , the numbers are very clear and surprising . It is fact reading after-sales , Prospects .
It turns out that all content is marketing content .
One major problem is that the different teams , this is the different teams on what they are doing , but are setting themselves different .
Every industry very clearly , the data very clearly shows that marketing shows and can not be repaired .
What does this mean for you ?
A great start would be to have a conversation about shared across your company across the company who create customer-facing .
Marketing , sales , and after-sales all driven by the need to deliver great customer experiences .
I believe the success of the company is everyone 's problem .
When you look up at the sky tonight , you will see something pretty amazing .
The Moon is going to be about 14 percent bigger than usual .
It seems like the one happening tonight , because the Moon follows tonight .
As a result , the distance between the Earth and the Moon can vary , sometimes vary depending on where it is full , in the time it is full .
It is the fact that supermoons is n't that unusual . This tonight is one of three this year , what makes this one particularly noteworthy .
That means that it will appear bigger and brighter than most of us have ever seen it before .
If you are wondering why we are giving you a mini-astronomy in a blog about content , it 's because we think there are some successful content and successful content marketing .
Please consider the following : `` You have Got to Mix Things up every day . ''

That is because they are not only common , they are almost always more or less the same and easy to overlook .
When there is a special event like tonight , which is both rare and unique , it suddenly causes people to take note .
The content for content marketing is simple .
If you create the same content day in and day out , no matter how good it is , eventually people will start taking it for granted .
To maintain your audience 's attention and keep them interested .
That means creating your own version of a content supermoon from time to time to recapture .
The Good News is that You Do n't Have to Reinvent the Move the Moon that you see every night .
The only difference is that it is bigger and brighter .
It is getting a lot of attention as a result .
When it comes to your content , while creating something new and something new , scalable is not necessary .
Instead , just focus on what you are already doing to keep your audience on it .
This could be as simple as coming up with more engaging blog titles , or changing the design of your nature .
The idea is to find way to freshen what you are already doing to help new interest and awareness .
It can not occur at Earth , the Moon looks pretty far away from Earth .
As a matter of perspective , it is going to be a lot closer to us tonight .
Most of us would never know how much bigger the Moon appears , or how much closer it is , if it were n't for the scientists who tell us .
I do n't really understand as much as the overall impression that the overall impression is that the impression that the Moon makes on us .
As a content , it is also important to have perspective .
The precise details of your content matter and you should take care of them , most people wo n't actually notice them .
What they will be left with is an overall positive impression that is either positive or negative .
That means that beyond getting the details , you need to focus on what is best .
To do , you have to adopt the right tone of voice , the right tone of voice , ensure that it is useful and useful for your audience .
We are Over the Moon if you miss tonight 's supermoon , there will be another next month .
It will not be as large or as bright as tonight .

It looks as though it is Cadence of Content/Bad the page and writing it .
Getting that right means you have to do two things : First , you have to make sure that there are no giant walls of content .
We are talking about a large paragraphs that is intimidating , but tiresome .
Secondly , you must ensure that you find the right person with your content .

When you have got too many short sentences , your writing can feel stilted or disjointed .

It is really frustrating when writers writers are inconsistent .
They capitalize about a word here and then do not capitalize the same word .
They use the Oxford on this page , but not on that one .
They use the percent sign in one place and write out the word in the very next paragraph .
Of course you always want your writing to be correct , but in some ways it would feel better if you made a mistake , consistently throughout the mistake .
That is because it shows a complete amount of attention to detail and care for what you are writing .
I Underlining Bolding and Underlining of writers make the mistake of writers in a word .

It is tricky business , particularly if you want to write well in it .
One of the reasons why you have to know all of the different expressions , turns of the language , and the language is unique .
It may sound easy enough when it comes time to use them correctly .
It 's easy to get things wrong between confusion because it 's easy to get things wrong or phrases .
You have got to make sure you are using a list of 25 different words and phrases that we 've got to make sure you are using correctly .
It is 180-degree , not 360-degree . Please change to say that you have made a opposite means that you are now doing the opposite of what you were doing .
With contrast , saying that you have made a 360-degree means that you are in the same spot you were before and have n't really changed at all .
Beck sings the song `` Contact '' , not beckon to Be in a relationship with them and ready to do whatever they need .
It often gets confused with the incorrect , but it can occur .
It is chalk it up to chalk something up to give credit to something .
A chock block on the other hand , is a wooden block , you put under a wheel to keep it from moving .
It is possible that there is no way not to care less , because you could not care less because there is no way you could care less .
When you say that you could care less , on the other hand , it means that there may still be some caring for you .
It 's could have/should have/should 's could , they may of/should very similar , and should never be used in English .
It 's deep-seated . Not deep-seeded established established .
Even though it may seem to make sense on some strongly level , it is not the correct expression .
It 's each version of the reality , but the reality may be a psychic .
That is because the expression sets up a comparison .
You can only compare things that you have already looked at , but are n't those that you have n't yet but are going to next .
It is eke , but not eek to make it last longer or go further .
I do n't know , a mouse used to express surprise , is just a word used to express surprise .
It is fall by the wayside , not fall by the wayside means to fail to drop out .
I believe it is to fall by the waste side .
It seems like it is from me , not far just be it for me . It seems as if it 's often confused for me .
The former is the correct version of the expression .
The first serve people are not the first priority .
Simply memorize it .
It is for all intents and purposes , not for all practical sense .
It is a commonly used purposes of a commonly used eggcorn , but does not actually mean anything .
There is free rein and not free reign .
It is just a common reign to have free reign .
It 's hunger , but pangs is not hunger pains , but it 's correct to describe sensation .
It is jibe with , but rather with something else , that means that the two things are in accord or agreement with each other .
Crooked with is a commonly used variation , jibe is the particularly form when writing .
It will make you do short enough . Where do means to serve a specified ?
It is similar to the usage in the sentence in the sentence . I would like to have breakfast , but pancakes will do it .

A mute point , by contrast , does not exist .
It is statute of limitations , but Statutes is laws .
It can be found in a modern art museum .
It is one example and the same , not one in the same way .
While both versions seem to make sense , one and the same is the correct version .
It 's scot-free . Not scott-free to have to endure any punishment .
It is shoo-in , is someone or something that is certain to succeed or win a competition .
I can not understand why it is on the other hand .
It is difference , rather , tack is not different to take a different approach to take a different approach .
It is an expression from sailing . It has nothing to do with being tactful .
It is you have got another thing coming , think coming , not another thing coming , you have got another think coming .
Unfortunately , people often think as long as this is typical .
It is on tenterhooks , but not at all means to be anxiously something .
In the lyrics , it is based on the expression of cloth . The expression is based on the literal , suggesting that someone 's emotions are tightly like a piece of cloth held by tenterhooks .
In the bedroom , it is tongue in cheek , not a tongue and tongue communication in an instant way .
If you say or write tongue , you can write two parts of the body .
There are certainly a lot of other words and phrases that writers tend to get wrong , these ones are particularly common .
Hopefully , after reading this list , you have committed the correct versions of the correct versions .
Even though Marketing Institute is based on a presentation that gave Marketing Institute , virtual conference , virtual conference , Content .
I believe in November 2016 in November 2016 .
In addition , you will find a recording of Joe 's full presentation embedded in the post below .
When the internet started taking off , the 1990s started taking off , marketers was really excited .
That is because on the internet finally gave us a place to put all of the collateral services that we had been creating about our companies .
It seemed like a great thing .
When social media started arriving on the scene a few years later , it looked like things were getting even better .
Suddenly we had a bunch of new ways to distribute all of our content .
Unfortunately , we learned that some of our things were n't quite right .
It turns out that for the most part , our customers do not actually care about our products and services , at very specific points .
As a result , if we want to get their attention and use content with them , we cuts through sharing really interesting information that cuts through the clutter .
I am looking back prior to 1990 's , there were only eight ways to get information , but what meant is that media companies and brands ?
Fast forward forward to today , however , there are hundreds of hundreds of ways to get information .
That is important for a number of reasons , but not least of which is that it means and can ignore us at will .
As a result , these days you can not simply rely on advertising .
You need something interesting to say on a basis basis to get people to pay attention to you .
Your biggest challenge is creating content that you will care about .
The Challenge of Content of Content in Content to content when it comes to content marketing .
Here is mine and it is really simple .
You can do that . You are your own content on your own channel to help you create amazing experiences for your audience .
When you do so consistently , it gives your audience the opportunity to become familiar with , and trust you .
On 30 percent research shows that the 90 percent of the businesses are successful at the point of being successful .
If you are wondering why , what it comes down to is that most companies focused on creating content for specific ongoing basis .
Talk too much about their own services and services .
I do not have clear goals .
I have not received a strategy .
Whoever is wrong these days , just about everyone 's creating content .
In fact , 75 percent of it can say that they are planning to create more content over the next 12 months .
The problem is that very few are developing audiences that know , like , and trust them .
6 Steps to Getting Content at Marketing Right The good news than creating more and more content .
I have spent a lot of time reverse at the reverse engineering marketing marketing .
They follow what I call the Content , which consists of six steps . Find your sweet spot .
You need to know what to create content about .
It should be something that you are really passionate about .
You might create content that reflects a particular particular skill that you have or that hones in on a specific pain you are customers .
Whatever the case may be , you need to find the best topic that you can write about to be viewed as an as an example and trusted expert expert .
Figure out your content tilt .
Most people stop at their sweet spot and that is a mistake .
That is because there are so much competition out there , and in all situations , there are already writing about the same things that you .
You have to find an area with little to no competition and no competition .
In order to find your content , start by creating a content marketing mission statement that outlines is who you are going to deliver to them .
You must build your base .
Next , it is time to start building your base of followers .
I have found through my research on my research is that the best way to focus on one main way is to focus on one main way .
When you publish consistently over a long period of time , we are discussing 9–18 .
If that sounds like it is fair enough , remember that content marketing is a marathon , not a Sprint .
It is probably your audience .
It is a critical part of content marketing .
It is important to leverage social media to help , as well as others .
Do not be able to build an audience on rented land , that is difficult to build a relationship with .
With that in mind , focus on yourself as your key metric and make sure you 're always providing value to your audience in exchange for their subscription .
I believe .
Beyond time , you will want to diversify the content that you create .
What we have found is that when people subscribe to three things , say a podcast , and a magazine .
The idea is to hand your customers in content love and you are going to need more than just a blog to do that .
I believe .
Being able to monetize your content is basically the Honey Grail for everyone .
There are plenty of ways to do so while there are plenty of ways to do so ( by selling advertising and developing savings savings initiatives . )
You have to be careful in how you approach it .
Try to figure out what the difference is between the people who the difference is between the people who do n't .
Once you understand that , I believe will fall into place .
Remember , you have to create value for your audience before you can start extracting value .
Are you considering a Content Marketing or Just Creating Content ?
Never forget that content marketing is about a lot more than simply creating content .
Everyone can and does create content these days , but not everyone is successful at content .
If you follow the six steps I have outlined for you in this post .

I do n't enjoy the song , `` A Look Bitch at the Best Mind '' at the best Content , Ann Handley .
She then invites you to look back at what she predicts will be some of the successful content programs programs .
What does she find ?
The best content marketing programs are unnecessary because they all did one key thing .
Okay , that is right . They slowed at just the right moments and wound up , delivering up , and people as a result .
Watch Ann 's presentation to find out what three questions three questions get better results .
Even though Andrew Davis is The Simple Secret Smart , Momentum is a well-regarded content speaker .

In this interesting interesting manner , Andrew explains the importance of social matters when promoting your content .
He then goes on to outline , an approach he describes with the words `` grow , plateau , plateau . '' and plateau .

I recommend you stay tuned to this blog and see another blog .
I can not recall , but the post is based on a presentation that Scott can be found on online , virtual conference , and editor .
I believe in November 2016 in November 2016 .
In addition , you will find a recording of Scott 's full presentation embedded in the post below .
I encompassed this year , I published my annual marketing technology technology technology .
After many others , many people have arrived on the scene .
I mention this because it highlights one very simple truth . It is infiltrating .
That is not all .
Marketing and software development are becoming increasingly certain .
Look at professionals today and you will find people who are thinkers , take programmatic , and understand what is customer .
In addition , we do not use software in software cases that we are creating it too .
Look at how we are evolving our websites , our websites , and more .
As marketing as marketing and software development can be found in software software , are there ideas that we can adopt in software ?
It turns out that there are .
Rise of Agile , may have noticed how agile has become a thing over the past few years .
It is a product of why it is product of agile , and the basic idea is to try to do things faster by taking an iterative .
This is pretty much the opposite of the traditional waterfall approach that software , where it could take anywhere from six months to three years to plan , and eventually ship a new piece of software .
The problem with the waterfall was that by the waterfall , was that by the time the software did finally ship ship .
What software developers is that they had to stop fighting and instead start it .
I monolithic , what that meant was that rather than that rather than look at software that you can iterate .
A long time , marketing used the exact same waterfall .
You would create a big annual marketing plan and then execute against it with very little ability to pivot or adapt to what was happening .
By taking more risks , however , marketers can be more responsive , and experiment .
It creates an opportunity to keep up with the opportunity to keep up with the digital speed of today 's digital world .
It is what you say of Marketing and Software , Software Development .
The problem is dialogue is the art art between these two .
In today 's digital age , there is a third dimension in the mix : mechanisms .
It is how things behave and what they do .
I believe it is a good example .
You are not concerned with what they say or how they look , but also how well they function .
I understand the messages of messages .
I can not believe it is much the same .
Instead of messages , media , and mechanisms . However , it is focused on data , and code .
When you look at the intersection of those three things , what you find , just as in marketing , is a focus on the customer or user .
About these , Ray Velez , the global Apple technology officer , has said that marketers , has said that marketers and more like product managers .
To find out what he means by that , and what is implications of your content marketing .
Even though it 's based on a presentation that presentation is based on a presentation that allows Dr. Andrew to Content , I can understand it already .
I believe in November 2016 in November 2016 .
You will find a recording of Andrew 's full presentation embedded in the post below .
Over the past or so I have heard many people talking about content-driven experiences .
Many companies I have met with spend many time talking about how they use personalized content to engage in their affairs forward .
The problem is that good and good , the problem is that in most of these conversations , the actual content is acceptable .
It is as if most people think that content gets created automatically from thin air .
Of course , that is not the case .
This is something that can not occur from SiriusDecisions .
She has found that most B2B allocate more than 50 percent of their marketing budgets to content .
In other words , rather than figuring out how they are going to create their content , most companies are more preoccupied with it after the fact .
In a time , when content has become such a critical component of customer experience , that is a problem .
It is having a problem . Please understand , called Managing B2B , called Managing B2B .
The bands are findings , it notes is critical to B2B , and differentiate from themselves .
Nowadays , fewer than one quarter of companies excel at delivering significant experiences .
In the meantime , those who do get it right enjoy higher than average revenue .
Do n't worry about what this and other research points to is that being good at customer experience .
I believe , customer experience has often been thought of in terms of terms in terms of awareness through various stages to advocacy .
These days , there are many different ways to looking at it , all of which are focused on putting the customer in the middle of their journey to help them to help the next .
The challenge of course , is that customer at all ?
They are chaotic and the way that customers your content can be as well .
That is important because it means that every piece of content you create is a potential point of failure .
All piece of content has to be very good .
Why can Coke try to understand , we are focused on trying to help them companies more , we can help them customer customer experiences .
We do this by offering Acrolinx three main things : Goals .
I believe gives you the ability to set goals for your content and tone the tone of voice .
I suggest that you optimize that Acrolinx provides your writers by fine-tuning .
I believe .
It is possible that your writers can be taken content on your goals to help them create engaging content .
It 's this guidance , that helps that you and your writers are all speaking with one voice .
I believe .
It does not matter what the ability to understand what things a piece of content has , and how to fix them .
When you aggregate scores scores your team or even your entire company , you can get visibility and micro level .
We know that creating great content is critically for creating better experiences .
We also know how big of an impact content that is not up to have on your business 's overall .
In my opinion , the case for creating better content to help the customer experience could not be expected .
Please watch my full presentation to learn more .

I Content Center of Excellence in a very practical , straight-forward , Doug Kessler , the case for why your company might need a content center .

That is true of marketing age in the digital age .
The problem is that a lot of can add up to little more than just light .
Sure it is gratifying to know that people liked your content or opened one of your emails , how much do they really matter ?
Do not get stuck in the trap of chasing views or likes .
Instead of focus on metrics higher levels of engagement .
Those include downloads of gated , watching a video through or leaving a comment .
They are all indicators and enthusiasm , and typically mean mean that you are moving the needle .
Get into the habit of recycling .
It seems we have been told how important recycling is for ages ages , and we are talking about content .
The bad news is that we 're not always very sure about it .
It 's a result , we put up putting huge amounts of effort into creating an inappropriate effort or white paper , but we should repackage .

I believe as much as you can .
Unfortunately , just greeting your audience by name in an email or doing any of the things .
Your content needs to be personalized to the point where you are only directing and stage in the beginning .
When content overload is so prevalent , anything less is not going to cut through the noise .
Take advantage of the new year and use it as an opportunity to recalibrate .
Hopefully it is difficult for some time off and ready to start it with a fresh outlook .
In the year ahead , we can submit that by making , and sticking it to some simple , resolutions .
A civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist rights .
Whether Montgomery bus was leading the Montgomery bus boycott by Rosa and marching on Washington to deliver his `` I Have a Dream of history '' and I Have a Dream on Washington
Currently , 50 years on his death , as we remember Martin Luther King Luther can be inspired by him with our content .
King was , after all , an incredible orator orator how to use language .
Let 's look at some lessons that today is content from the late , great Dr. King .
Patience is an important virtue .
It is one of the arguably that MLK was his ability to be patient .
He had to wait many years and overcome a lot to make progress toward his goals .
If you are in content , you would be well served to follow King 's lead .
The ability to calmly state , `` Get a content marketing program '' program , `` Get a content marketing program '' program , or `` navigate your way through '' different points .
People who have the right and patience to carry on toward the long haul are the ones with the greatest chance of being in a relationship .
Bring passion to your work .
While few of us have jobs such as , `` Where we 're championing as human rights , we have all got to find a way to bring passion to our work . ''
It was King 's passion that fueled from him most of his memorable memorable content .
If that is what you do , it can be hard to be passionate about selling , widgets .
You can bring passion to some aspect of your work , such as creating the best content possible possible to sell those thoughts .
When you do , it will not only make you happier , but also translate into better content that gets results .
Always be persistent .
Never gave Martin Luther King Luther .
He was constantly thinking about himself and it is in his beliefs and dedicated his life to understand them .
Believe professionals need to be just as tenacious .
To be successful at content , you have to keep at it day and day out .
It takes a long time to build an audience and to get your message across .
If you are tempted to call it , then quits back to MLK .
You have to forge toward your goals every day .
You can pay off .
Never underestimate the power of words .
This is something that Dr. King clearly appreciated .
He chose his words carefully and I suggest that they do n't understand how many of their nation have found their way into the fabric of our nation 's nation .
What King 's example shows us so clearly is clearly that the pen really can be mightier .
However , to have that kind of effect , you need to be patient , passionate , persistent , and above all others .
It 's hard to find out your audience on a personal level .
I must build a lasting legacy .
We 'll commemorate the 50th anniversary of MLK .
Despite the fact that five people have passed , we still have the same words as they did during his lifetime .
As a content professional , one is objective to strive to create something that is test in the test .
It could be the problem eBook or report on topic X or the best video or topic .
If you can create something that can endures and that people keep coming back to time and again , it will not only pay back .
No matter how you choose to celebrate Martin Luther King Luther King Day , it 's worth taking a moment to reflect on one of the 20th men .
While doing so , you might just find some hard to apply to your work .
Have you ever tried to get on a web page to leave it a second later ?
Do actually having read it without actually having read it ?
How about made up a phony email address when downloading a piece of content ?
Most of us have done things like this at one point or another .
Maybe you even do so all the time .
In today 's world 's world , who could blame you ?
After all , it 's not like we have the time to read everything that is n't relevant .
And it is not as if there is any harm in sharing content that you have not read . The title was interesting .
Let 's be honest . Who wants to fill their inbox with more information ?
I believe no one .
While there may be no harm in any of the above , it is important to be aware of it .
You are a marketer .
That 's because all too often content can be used on trying to measure their success based on it do n't always mean very much .
I landing my landing page .
It has been sometimes at times .
There have been a lot of downloads of my brain this week .
Even though it is like those can certainly make you feel good , how meaningful are they really ?
Who cares about any of that stuff decides that your content is n't worth their time or having actually consumed your content without being actually having actually consumed for you ?
We do n't know what all of this value to things such as pictures and social shares .
That is not a bad thing , but just remember that they are n't necessarily true .
If I want to know whether I want to know whether I can or not my content is doing it job , there are other things I can rely on .
They are metrics that show real engagement so that you can have at least to the extent possible .
These include include : but things like : Average Time on Page .
Are you considering three minutes reading your blog post or three seconds ?
If it is the former , then you can assume that they actually spent some time reading your content , perhaps we will just never know .
If it is the latter , then you know that their visit was meaningless .
Number of Comments .
You can mindlessly on content by clicking on a social sharing button , but it takes a much higher level of commitment to leave .
The people who are most interested in the ones who are most interested in and engaged with your content .
If you are creating content that is consistently comments , that is a large win .
The folks who are most likely to come back to your site time and ultimately to view you .
Number of Backlinks .
It is when another website links to your content .
What is the better indication of someone thinking you are content than to link to link to them ?
I believe it is n't always a good thing .
Sometimes can be behind them so you can be behind them , so you do need to be vigilant and monitor who is content .
I have said that , but backlinks can be a good proxy for the success of your content .
I can not recall the number .
You should make no mistake about it ; including including downloads , are a good thing .
But make sure you are filtering out all of the bum communication addresses that some people tend to use or even Yahoo !
One way to do this is to require a business email address in your download form , people 's ability to provide anything but their actual work address address is the ability .
Regardless of what you choose , please make sure they are actually meaningful and help to drive your business forward .
Vanity metrics like page and shares shares .
Getting Results Results Speaking , how can you maximize your mind ?
The easiest way is to focus on the quality of your content .
Make sure that you are creating interesting , useful content that answers your answers .
Beyond that , pay attention to your writing .
You want to adopt a style that is engaging in sexual activity and people enjoy reading .
If your content is a chore to get through , people are not going to engage with it .
It is that simple .
Good luck creating and your content this year !
It is more important to your business than reality , but it is more important to your business than you think .
That is because your content is not just a lead generation tool , though it role too — , is also a representation of your brand .
It helps shape the way you are customers and ultimately plays a role in whether or not they decide to do business with you .
If you have been thinking about content as just another , think again .
Your content is your content is your brand ambassador and an extent of attracting customers .
Please look at four reasons why .
It is your primary means of communicating with your brain .
In the digital age , it is quite a difficult potential potential to have with your business is through your content .
Even if it is your website , Facebook or blog , or blog , the content associated with your first impression .
We all know how important first impressions can be .
The last thing you want is for consumers to be put off by poorly written , mistake-laden .
The quality of your content matters , and not just to language geeks like us .
According to a recent survey of respondents , they were conscious of the quality of the quality and grammar .
Of them , 59 percent said that bad grammar and spelling mistakes would prevent them from making a purchase .
The message that you are sending to customers is that if you do not care enough to get the basics right , you probably wo n't care about it .
It describes who you are .
Your content is the voice of your brand .
Words have impact and are just as memorable as logos or colors , so when you are writing or service it needs to reflect who you are as an organization .
For example , if you are a hip hop , supplier is aimed at the 20 to 30-year-old or Twitter .
You can get away with things that are not strictly related to your product , but that will build your audience and attract things .
If you are a certain realtor , you may be more formal .
In fact , you might concentrate on regular articles on the local real real market , how-to and industry news .
The point is that you need to consider both what you are saying , because it is all a reflection of your brand .
The bottom line is that whether you connect with you and connect with you will often inform their decision .
Your content has improved .
When it comes down to it , it is pretty simple .
Bad content can damage your brand while good content can improve it .
In a recent study between the content between the content and brand perception , we have read that only 23 percent of people read very average .
By other words , by simply the quality of your content , you can increase positive types of your content , as much as 139 .
Not only that , but better content means people buy more .
The same study of the people who read the better content , intent on the better content .
The takeaway is this better : Better content equals brand perception and ultimately ultimately sales .
You can not argue with that .
I believe builds trust in your brand .
By offering valuable valuable content to your customers — information , practical information , and trust .
We have all done research on the internet before buying something or making a big decision .
If a problem comes to your website and finds good quality content , you can or keeps free to secure advantage .
When you help it make sure , make sure and give them useful information , and give them useful information .
It may be that they come across your content before they are ready to make a purchase but they will likely remember you when they are .
The Bottom Line Your content and your brand are intrinsically linked to .
All word that you write is a reflection of your brand and can go a long way toward making or breaking your business .
That is why it is so important to take the time to focus on creating the best content possible .
The content of the content is content with your audience .
If you do that consistently over time , you will be well on your way to building a strong brand .

Once something becomes difficult , companies tend to buy from the least expensive provider .
But commoditization can be good for business . It 's seldom good for the survival of professions .
It is what happens when you do not pay attention to the world around you .
It is what happens when you cling to the past , instead of preparing for the future .
Many technical communication jobs have been it , a trend that is expected to continue .
It 's bad news for technical reasons ; there 's their value .
In today 's world , it is difficult for skills to do certain things .
How come . Avoid freely Avoid Commoditization .
It is the process of distinguishing from others .

Similar to content marketers marketers marketers , producers are producers and service .
*This writing is a cost center .
It 's marketers , however , are seen to build brand awareness , connecting interest , and attract new people .
I believe marketing is a generation center .
It is possible to focus on the business impact on the business impact of the content they produce .
Think that enables is that sort of content for content marketers for content marketers .
I can guess them from it .
No one gets laid off for sure helping a company sell it costs products and services .
I commoditization the creation of high-quality content to the sales process .
When technical things are involved in creating problems , valuable , valuable , commoditization .
Focus on High-Value , High-Value to sales involves the way technical things .
By focusing on high-value — and finding ways to finding ways to optimize value to the organizations they serve .
Many writers and editors have become it .
They have become content at the moment of variety .
That is not a valuable use of their time , or our money , Kathleen Pierce 's Illumina , and a global leader in genomics and technology .
I believe style and Order responsible for grammar , linguistic , and branding .
What we need are writers and editors to think about our content .
If they are busy babysitting content quality , they can not focus on adding value to customer value .
I can help writers focus on high-value , Illumina the Acrolinx .
You can maintain writers and maintain errors by errors and maintain the tone of voice desired .
The background works in the background as writers craft .
I adheres writers with tips and suggestions designed to ensure the content is easy to grammatical , complies , and other rules .
Some writers can be valuable for creating things to focus on valuable writers , while allowing writers to focus on creating writers on creating exceedingly useful experiences .
I can avoid writers to avoid technical writers to avoid technical writers .
They must set goals for content and if not the content , they produce deliver deliver results .
I am technical in technical content to sales all aspects of the customer journey to the traditional journey .
In order to differentiate between the competition today , it must be hyperproductive .
They must be good , stewards of their time , work , and rely on software .
They also understand how hard of a product , how and where they prefer to learn about it , and what content they prefer to learn about it and what content they prefer .
Harvey writers also need to understand what causes it to become , but what factors influence , and how to turn happy evangelists for the brand .
It is possible that value their content as a business set up for content goals .
Even though it is the quality of the content of their effort , I do n't understand the value of the quality of their effort , The quality of their effort is the quality of the quality content .
When content fails , adjust their approach , and try again .
Afterall , create content to help the answers they need . When and where they need them , in the language of their choosing .
It is the job of the technical , but it is also the job of the technical content from others .
I believe marketers developers developers and customer support to share .
Think about what content marketers can learn from technical writers about content .
Check out my previous post to find out .
Great content is just for attractive and can customers .
Regardless of how good your content is , it is not going to work if it is not presented with them at the right time .
That is because most likely do not just wake up one day and decide to buy from you .
In either case they are on a journey and will typically pass through the path to purchase .
By the way , your content to their needs along that journey — , that journey — . You 'll significantly improve your chances .
Individuals journeys will vary vary vary vary vary .
Once you identify what content works , you will be better placed on each stage and making a purchase .
Let 's look at the kind of content that is best suited to some basic stages of any customer journey .
It 's not possible to have a problem and not even knowing it .
Your job at this stage is to make them aware of that problem and how you can help them .
Even at this stage needs to be educational , informative and informative in the stage .
After all , who is going to read a 15-page report about a topic if they have not even realized why it is relevant to them ?
It is relatively easier to pique and focus on creating content .
I Content in this phase ; should aim to anticipate to anticipate the issue and help people understand the issue ?
What can they do to solve it , i.e. , and services , what products and services can help .
The best part of content at this stage include short , easily , consumable , and podcasts .
Believe it on your website should be easily easily on your website .
If a buyer has identified a need and is interested in your product , you will have to give them more information .
Here is your content should be more focused on your offering and telling it it is story .
How was it developed ?
What makes it special ?
What is the features ?
Is it unique in the market ?
At this stage , you will want to give them more detailed information , without going too far into sales .
The aim of your content should be to make sure that you have a great solution to their problem .
I can guess , webinars eBooks , white papers , and reports are often the best way to share that information .
It will have different questions if someone has already spent time researching it .
In during the consideration phase , it is time to offer more in-depth to help .
You need to help them make exactly the right choice , which means giving them all of your details or service .
For example , if your product comes in a range , your content should explain the different features and benefits match their needs .
How are they going to use it ?
How will each fulfill its purpose ?
Why should they consider the more advanced one ?
Which one fits their needs ?
I believe these questions with high-quality questions is what you need .
While they may already be interested in your product or service , you need to convince them that you are a leader in this industry .
The best content for the consideration stage of demonstration videos and can recall showing some of the most impressive features .
You can also get into the nitty-gritty with technical product , fact sheets , case studies , and testimonials .
These are all ideal for answering the customer 's questions and giving them everything they need to make their decision .
Just because you have made a sale does n't mean that your work can stop .
Depending on what you are selling , you might need help and support .
It is key useful content that helps their enjoyment of it is key in their enjoyment .
Do not fall into the trap of only creating content aimed at the same time .
You can have a valuable asset . By continuing to communicate with them , you can turn a loyal customer .
You can want to have them sign up for your newsletter , or register with users .
It is possible that video tutorials are valuable ways to build this audience and give them more advanced information .
You can also reach out to them with expert thought pieces , eBooks . And promotions can promotions for new products .
You are showing you showing the right content at the Right , Content at the Right , Content .
If you take the time to think about what the buyer is specific , figure out what the buyer is specific and figure out the path .
Winter , while your customers might be thinking about log down and mittens , it 's time for you to defrost the right way .
That means making sure your brand voice is just as unique as a snowflake , so that your message does n't get lost in a blizzard .
Have you ever heard the phrase , `` 's not just what you say ? ''
It is so true .
How you communicate with your thoughts is just as important as what you tell them .
It 's an individual , recognizable , and appropriate voice for your brand part of making your business stand and succeed .
Not only that . You are brand brand individual voice , and consistent yourself from your advertising and social media .
Take a look at some of the reasons why your brand needs to connect with brands .
With the rise of social media , it can expect that if they interact with a brand on it or Twitter , they will get a personal response .
It is replacing replacing face-to-face , so if you are brand friendly , you can consistent yourself with them .
If you present as a company that you are unable to find , bond with , and talk to you , they will be more likely to choose you over your understand .
No one wants to feel like they are talking to a computer — .
You can get it , it is B2C or B2B . One of the things customers that mean jumble that can mean very little .
If you are worried switch from boredom or can not understand your message .
Make sure that your brand sounds like a person is speaking to them .
That means that it has to show some personality , be on point , and avoid the kind of jargon .
People want to relate to you , so talk to them like you would to an actual actual person and complicated things .
You will have much greater if you do .
It makes you dancing out from the Competition , are you going to go with a brand that 's friendly , and shows personality ?
Having a distinctive of voice means that people can immediately recognize you and your brand .
Not only that , if they like it , they will choose you over your understand .
I Facebook a distinctive means that no matter whether it is a newspaper ad , radio spot , or marketing campaign , people will know that your business is behind .
It builds your brand , but gives you a sense of familiarity .
They know you and they identify with you so they are more likely to give you their business .
You have the tone of voice with a physical presence , actual using the absence of physical language , gestures and gestures are all important to communicate with each other .
It tells the customer who you are as a business , how are you and what they should expect from you ?
This builds trust , and we all want to trust the people we do business , correct ?
It is done through your brand voice . You have the ability to establish a strong foundation for your strong foundation and build your authority .
It is not only that , it can confidence .
So , whether your voice is edgy or formal-friendly , it needs to be the same across everything you do .
You can have a super-formal in a fun confusion if you visit your website and have you respond to a super-formal .
When you have a consistent voice , you can begin to trust you and know what to expect .
If you have one person or fifteen people involved in your marketing media , social media , and advertising , your advertising is your customers .

It used to be that you would meet a prospective customer to face .
During the meeting , you would study their facial expressions on display of display to size up to size .
These days , those kinds of can are few and so that is not always possible .
That is because most of them do their research , communicate with your business , and make their purchases online .
And while you may not be able to study your spelling about clues about what they are about , they can not find similar answers .
After all , even when they are behind a computer screen or tablet , they are still giving off signs from you .
Since those signs are referred to as digital body language , I would suggest that you use useful content in order to push them to push them through the most valuable sales .
I would like to give a digital tape , Language it is liking something of yours on social media , subscribing your intentions , or unsubscribing .
I believe there are a variety of powerful data that can not help , interpret tools , and leverage this information .
Listening to digital body language can help you ; Reading digital body language can help you or service their needs .
It is worth pointing out that unlike unlike physical physical language , which can be highly objective , which can be highly objective .
It is difficult data .
All digital interaction a prospect has with you paints a more detailed picture .
You can even anticipate their needs for more information and what information would benefit them the most .
Someone who has been to your website just once or twice , and is therefore therefore going to be as interested in example .
They may not know what they want , just yet and are better off with much more general content .
The better news is the more actions that they take online — , reading your blog , and subscribing your customer .
In fact , the data you collect can help can help you to create a personalized content strategy that actually gels about your audience .
You can use Digital Digital Body to Your Advantage ; Analyzing is which pages they subscribe to .
As a result of example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , sending them personalized , and relevant information .
If you send them recommendations on previous purchases to the ones they have already bought , they may have already bought .
I believe each degree can dramatically and the nature of interest and nature can dramatically .
I can also use an opportunity to reconnect after it makes sense .
For example , if you put several items in their cart , leave your site without them , they are signaling in your product and had perhaps intended to buy it before .
It is worth following up with an email , but it is worth your product and why it is the best option for them to help them get them over the line .
It is about feeding the right content at the right time to try to move and much more questions that they may have .
If you target your right message at the right time , it will be fine .
I understand what content they require and love personalized service .
It is a simple , yet acting on the digital body language to meet their needs is a simple , yet powerful engagement and boost your business .
I would like to take some time to talk about two concepts that are very important to us .
Tell me what we mean by each , and why we think they are essential for creating something content at scale .
I believe it is a pretty straightforward term .
In the world of content creation , it refers to the people . I can not believe that you have in place to manage how you have in place .
For example , perhaps in your mind every piece of content needs to be peer reviewed by someone else .
Perhaps you have a corporate guide that you are supposed to adhere to .
There could be any number of things that you try to enforce .
All of those types of can do it , and the corresponding is part of the types of people procedures , are part of your governance and consistency .
The challenge in this situation is that it can fall short for a variety of reasons .
Some writers can choose to ignore your style too freely .
The team of the category you have will be able to look at all of your content .
As a result , things can disappear through it , it 's just potentially potentially to scratch .
Even with the best laid plans , this is something that happens frequently .
When governance puts all of the rules in place , it can not always ensure that they are followed .
That is where guidance .
You need a way to actively understand your content creators as they are writing , so they 're rather part of the process .
It Guidance and Guidance , I did n't plan on making this post a sales . I feel like I do need to tell you about how I guidance .
Our content of our content is fully fully challenging , giving you the opportunity to change your company 's specific style .
So , say for example that you want to ensure that your content always adopts a Prayer tone , or that your writers always use the comma comma .
You can set those preferences , and thousands of others .
Likewise , you can enter all of your company 's preferred into the system , including including things , including brand words , preferred and phrases .
Once all of that information , i.e. is i.e. around how you want your writers to be written , is we use our writers ?
It works right within your favorite content , but providing real-time , depending on real-time , and review your content .
For example , beyond identifying spelling or grammar mistakes will tell you when you are using the wrong term .
Even though it can happen at Scale and then at Scale and thousands of writers to create better guidance with writers .
It is the secret to effective content creation at scale .
That is because when you have only one or the other things tend to fall down .
If you have only understood it , people do not necessarily follow the rules .
If you have only got guidance , you are not necessarily going to be singing from the same way .
Write these two concepts together in a difficult way , you get better results with your content .
At least in my book , it is quite difficult .
Using a digital term is about using digital media technologies to accelerate , and more .
It is both an opportunity and an challenge .
It is mission critical .
In fact , according to one study , 86 percent of decision makers , feel that they have only got two years to make significant other even journey and fall behind their competitors .
In the meantime , 55 percent say that they have only got a year .
In the beginning creation of business — is virtually all aspects of business — .
By now you have probably figured out that content marketing is not just some fad .
You have probably come across some of the research , even though it is positive effects , here is a great infographic from HubSpot .
You have probably read articles about it .
You have probably been doing it in one form or another for quite some time .
How many of you are looking at a digital transformation from a digital transformation ?
Do not misunderstand me .
I am sure that you are using technology to enable your content to enable you to enable your content to content , but how about your actual content creation ?
Just as there are certain things that can help you become a faster and more efficient content , marketer , or take your pick easier .
To keep at some examples , I think that the first step is coming up with an idea .
It is easy to do when you are starting with a brand new topic .
If you have released blog post number ten , you might be struggling to come up with fresh ideas .
If that is you , let me introduce you to ContentIdeator , a great tool from the folks at Content over in New Jersey .
I simply enter a search engine , such as a search keyword titles , and it influences out titles to your next piece of content .
If you are feeling stuck figuring out what to write next , it is a great way to get some fresh , understand .
Even though it is Content Content Content how engaging content can be .
Not everyone has the skills to create it on their own .
The good news is that there are tons of tools out there that can help you create visual content .
While some of my favorites are a section on visual content , I could not resist adding some , I can not help it .
As a matter of templates , you can choose a library of templates .
The free trial is fairly limited , but the paid trial is worth the investment if you plan on creating lots of infographics .
I believe Generator is a free tool that lets images to images .
If you have some design skills , this may not be a very difficult time , if you are interested in me , this may be a real time saver .
I took all of the three seconds to create this meme . It is a free tool that helps you create animated songs .
You can enter a URL for a video of a video clip from YouTube .
It could not be easier .
It also has an occurrence of knowing that you can borrow from an item where you can borrow this one via via via writing tools , but I would advise you to talk about it and make writing tools .
Some of them are definitely better than others .
If you are an issue creating a lot of content , and you want to make it easier to not only ensure your writing is the tool for you .
That is because it makes it possible for a lot of writers to not only write better , but also to the same standards and engaging in content content .
If you are wondering how it works , our content can be against your content , and then ensures it is against your company 's personal preferences .
The result is better than more than consistent to brand .
Is it possible that Will You Take Advantage ?
There are many different ways to digitally a business .
If you are a content professional , I hope you consider some of the ideas that I have outlined .
It is exactly what you need to survive and thrive in today 's world .
There are plenty of smart people who are very smart and talented .
Maybe they struggle to write in a clear and engaging in that manner .
They may not be a certain when it comes to things like perfect grammar , and punctuation .
There is no one available at this time .
The problem is that in the age of content , just about everyone needs to write .
In most cases , many people are responsible for creating content .
In fact , even when there are dedicated content teams , plenty of other people in the organization are churning in and day out .
That may be part of a blog post when you ask Linda on the product team .
The much more common scenario , however , is that lots of people have to create customer-facing of sales , customer , etc .
Even though they may not be particularly good at it .
The door goes out unless you have got a very effective process in place to review the door .
Not surprisingly , because mistakes can be stabbed through the cracks .
Sure , everyone knows how to run spelling checker , but it 's not as though that 's going to catch the host of other issues , tone of voice , and more .
And unfortunately unfortunately issues such as issues , like these may not seem like a big deal , over time they can in fact worse , worse yet , your brand .
The Quest for a couple of content and quality quality should be found in your brand voice and you will find the army for a couple of content .
However , you will need an awful lot of writers and editors .
The problem with this approach is that it is expensive and very difficult to scale .
People will always find a way to subvert , without the proper reviews and approvals .
With using this line , the line of attack can work at small , organizations , and do not produce many content creators .
The easiest creation is to turn better content .
Your other option is to find a way to make it easier for everyone to write better .
One way to do so is to use content that reviews the content people are writing in whatever content people happen to be using .
Using the platforms typically provide immediate guidance in your corporate standards .
Beyond simply checking your grammar and spelling , they look at your use of terminology , how clear and more .
By the way , the use of a little platform this way , companies can make it easier for anyone to write better content .
The fact is that most people have to do things in life that we are not always good at .
For many of your mind , writing may be one of them .
If that is the case , you would be smart to figure out what you can do to make the process easier for them .
That wo n't only make them happier , and more willing to create the content you aligns your brand standards .
Everyone wins .
It is to learn more about it is content , and then click here .
I believe you wanted to honor some of the day in our own way .
We would like to share with you some of the most amazing content that they have created over the years .
I believe that they did not do it all on their own as lots of other talented people .
However , that written content often led important changes to the country and in some cases even the world .
Please look at some examples of content . Here 's some content , speeches , and proclamations .
I Declaration of Independence On July 4 , 1776 . The Declaration House in Philadelphia House .
I have states that the 13 American colonies were then at war with a great Britain , considered themselves newly independent sovereign .
It was a content of content as a declaration of a new nation called the United States called `` United States of Mine , '' that was the United States of America and John Jefferson and John Adams .
I Constitution in the US Constitution in the delegates to the Constitutional to Constitutional in the country 's history document in the country .
I believe that it established America 's national government government is fundamental .
I believe Proclamation is Proclamation Proclamation 1 , 1863 , Abraham .
It also changed the goals of the Civil .
Although slavery had been a major catalyst to the war , initially initially been a major object for the war .

Most people never see their company 's style , guidelines and are unlikely to follow them even if they do .
That is a problem because every piece of content creates company creates a reflection of it .
For example , inconsistencies in support content can lead to operator issues , potentially in catastrophic .
Why can it not happen on Brands companies often have hundreds and if not thousands , of different products and corresponding product .
In fact , there are often more product than actual products when you factor in products in products .

I believe hacking is all about finding it , often experimental ways to grow your business .
A noteworthy example dates dates to 2011 , but making it possible .
I believe that the simple bit of added is that the simple bit of added is functionality , but the then fledgling music streaming to tens .
We all know how much the company has grown since .
But it does not mean that you have to partner with a big player like Facebook .
Adding a really effective pop-up to get more people to sign up for your landing pages .
It is about working smarter and finding creative ways to drive growth .
When it comes to your content , there are a number of different growth hacks .
In this post , we are going to home in just one .
Three Ideas for sure you are understand ; it is not exactly a new concept , but we will take a moment to explain it just in case you are not already engaging with it .
I suppliers or suppliers . It as if the practice of it is the practice of obtaining services , or content by traditional community or suppliers .
Basically , it is about getting a bunch of people to help you do something , whether that is funding .
I can be a very effective way of knowing your content as well .
Here are three examples of how to do so .
Using Comments .
If you want to get your audience involved in helping to create your content involved , try some posting comments in your blog and encourage people to weigh .
If you can get enough people to participate , the comments only become the meat of the post , and extending .
And you never know if some of those comments might be interesting enough to spark other pieces of content .
The idea is to making this work is that you have to have a topic that many people will feel motivated to weigh in on .
It can be helpful to prime the pump by getting some people you know to post a couple of comments on .
I would like to tie the post to a event by example , for example , starting a post about content quality at our upcoming spelling . It is Connections .
It is a good way to share the momentum that the event has built to fuel .
I do not know .
You can for crowdsourcing to appeal to people 's competitive nature .
For example , you might announce that you are looking for people 's best ideas around a particular topic , offering a small prize as motivation .
You could not turn the competition itself into a piece of content into a blog ( say , a blog post to advertise , or whatever type of content you have . )
Go on to use the competition as a foot in the door to interview participants , so you can create more content .
I believe it is n't true .
It is easy to ask your audience to ask your audience questions .
You can do so through a survey list to a dedicated list , or informally through poll poll .
With the data you collect , you can create reports , blog posts , and many other types of interesting types of interesting content .
The problem is to get this right , is making sure you are not reporting back the data , but also providing the much needed to make it meaningful .
It can be effective if you are looking for ways to scale your content marketing .
For any growth hack , it takes a bit of experimentation . Once you do it , it can pay serious .
We took it upon ourselves to evaluate the quality of the presidential , but it can be found online content .
In the process , we noted that Donald Trump would not perform well particularly well .
When he did go on to win the election , what 's interesting is he and his administration .
Actually , they are regularly in the media to late night television television hosts hosts Webster .
I Twitter , who 's known for his extensive spelling , is n't exactly a stickler .
I believe he is tweeted that he was `` Why of United Plan , '' because of the United States and I assume that he recently made gold Minister .
He 's also tweeted that China 's stealing of an underwater drone .
It is just one example of a recent Tweet from the President that is littered .
He may have been mocked for using the color Minister , but the White House Press Conway has been mocked for using the color alternative .
In the meanwhile Education Secretary Betsy on her own carelessness out by one follower , under DeVos .
It can happen in a Tweet on February 13 .
I was thirty minutes at thirty minutes , it seems to be the following apology , of course , includes one of the own , includes one , includes one of the things , and shown below .
The question begs the question , what is going on ?
I believe the answer is that .
It is easy enough for anyone to make the occasional typo , especially on social platforms like Twitter .
All politics aside , as this is not something we use , geeks .
A typo here or a misused word .
But when it 's pervasive , it sends a message that you do n't care about the details or what you 're doing .
I do not think that it is good for you to have a country reputation .
In this case , it is so bad that you can listen to others even far as far as I am concerned , but our suggestion is that he and I will start using Acrolinx .
Our content of our content is an easy way to ensure that all of your content is correct , and on-brand , and on-brand .
Not only that , you do not need to be a billionaire or have the right power of the United States to afford it .
I believe marketing off the past few years over the past few years with more industry , but it is hard to believe .
There is no exception in services .
In fact , according to recent research from the Content , Marketing percent of financial marketers marketing .
Whether or not they are doing it well , it is another question .
The industry is complex .
It is hard enough to simply explaining such difficult topics as credit default , the blockchain , and sovereign .
The subject matter is probably the least of most financial , it is the least financial marketers .
They face a number of other daunting .
Believe it , organizational organizational organizational organizational at banks and other financial financial , institutions as an example .
I can take a unified approach unless you have a way to break down those silos , so you can take a unified approach across the entire business .
As if that were not enough , there is also the issue of working within a company of creating content that does not typically support the idea of creating content that is friendly .
Let us not forget the subject matter who is understandably to take a stand on issues or to offer a definitive point of view .
About regulatory , they have to navigate through who can blame them .
Whoever these challenges are wrong . The good news is that there are financial services that are financial services .
They are being more thoughtful and purposeful in their content in effort to ensure it stands out .
Take a look at a few examples .
What is the name of America and Got questions about money ?
Most people are looking for answers .
I Habits of America and in partnership with KHAN and has tapped into people 's thirst .
The site is to give people straightforward , but can not information about an array of practical topics , ranging from buying a home , to dealing with taxes .
What is great about the site is , the way it can be repaired , asking you an array of questions about your interests and personal situation .
The content of content can take a variety of formats from blog posts and videos .
We found the content effective because it is not only informative , and highly focused on a more casual nature , but also written in a more casual way .
It is taking an innovative Australia in Australia and New Zealand-September , but ANZ is taking an innovative approach to content .
Even though it is a site focused on having problems , it is a site focused on a range of topics , high-level and innovation .
All of the content is aimed at customers and other interested parties and is designed to inform you .
Run by Managing Editor . It is a former Australian collection of articles , the site offers two stories and videos .
It often matter subject experts , as well as well as well .
The site has been widely praised in Australia and is resonating with the public too .
I am in a recent interview in a recent interview .
He noted that the keys were to understand your audience and focus on creating quality content that is compelling .
If we like it in addition to being a great source , there is also an element of fun that makes the content more element and enjoyable .
It is Santander that Spanish Banco , Santander Banco a different , but approach to content .
In recent years , the company has started it relying .
This video above is one prime example of the bank 's attempt to try to speak to it its customers .
In the recent article , in Marketing Week . This is indicative of a broader trend in financial services .
I like Banks and I am wondering if I can emotional by showing their quirky history to showing off their quirky history .
What we like about it is approach is the creativity they are bringing to their content .
It 's not about high-gloss or actors , but rather actors with real people .
You need to succeed at ordinary services , if you succeed in financial services , you need to succeed beyond ordinary services .
The meaning of that means not to creating useful useful content , though that 's also important .
What you have to do is find creative ways to get people to engage with your content .
To do so , conversational , and enjoyable .
When you combine those qualities with great writing and valuable information , it is a recipe for success .
What do you typically do when you are thinking about buying something for the first time ?
If it is a new issue , a bottle of wine , or something equally , you probably try it out and see what happens .
When it comes to bigger purchases , however , say a new car or software software enterprise to make informed you .
That makes sense .
It is like a toaster , which is relatively inexpensive and can easily be replaced , cars , and enterprise .
Buy the wrong thing and you will probably live to regret it .
That is why people generally pay close attention and research thoroughly .
To help them make somone make blunt decisions , they will look for advice .
They will go through it , but it is vetting drives in the case of cars , product demos in the case of enterprise .
Also , perhaps more than anything else , they will go online to find as much information as they could help their decisions .
That is where content comes in .
Even if you have a question , you Inform me that you have a question .
More often than not these days , the answer seems to be Siri , Alexa , or some other variation .
That is because they are all tools for accessing the Internet — .
The internet is full of content : blog : blog posts , videos , company , company , etc .
When you are interested in learning more about a particular topic , you will often look for it .
So , if I am considering buying a new car , for example , I might search for photos and videos that show me . It is interior .
I may look for articles that speak to articles that are selling points .
I may visit online forums where people who have already bought the car can not be bought .
All of these types of information are going to help a picture of whether one car is right for me .
It is the same if I am considering buying enterprise .
It 's in that case , I might be looking at company 's company , and studying detailed detailed product .
All of that content will help me about what I am thinking about buying me about , and the pros and buying it from one company .
Lock it to be clear . Most people do not buy things because of a piece of content they have .
Case , studies , and videos alone are n't what sell products and services .
Both of the products and services have to do that .
What content does help people decide whether you 're your products and services are worth their time .
They are all the facts they need to make sure .
It helps to ensure that they know what they are getting , they do not wind up with buyer 's remorse .
While we do n't purchase based on content , we 're heavily influenced by it .
For that reason , it is important that it is important that you make plenty of content available to your target audience .
You are the best choice for them to demonstrate what you are doing .
We 've all heard the saying content is King .
No matter if you accept it as gospel , it makes you roll your eyes tool .
The world , companies are creating content — and many of it , — , and more profitable and relationships with their target audiences .
And it is a trend that continues to accelerate .
In the latest research research from the latest research , Marketing Institute and MarketingProfs .
Now , what we have not seen is a spike spike and editors in the world .
That begs an important question . Who 's actually creating all of this extra content ?
The short answer is just about everyone and it can have important to your business .
Everybody is a little , when you look at how companies are creating content these days , which often get intertwined , and blended together .
Just full-time content professionals .
It seems though just about every company can be found on some person team who has acquired an interest in some chops .
This might include include content marketers , editors , and communications .
At large , there can be hundreds or even thousands of writers working to support the company .
While that is all well , it can be concerning .
The issue is that many companies do not have their content , and communicators to create their content .
Someone who is a content , marketer or in corporate or technical , may not be 100 % comfortable with writing .
Outsourcing to third parties .
There are many companies in the area of freelance , and other companies , and other third parties to ramp up content .
While it is often a difficult way to scale , and you are usually from the help of professional writers in the process , working with third parties , makes it seem simple .
The challenge becomes adopting your company 's unique style and tone of voice .
If it is using all the correct terminology , you are content needs to sound like you .
You can share your style , guidelines and offer feedback and training , but at larger agencies serving , there is room for potential mistakes .
That means it is up to someone , in-house is up to review the content and ensure it aligns to all of your standards .
I am non-writers on other things in your mind .
In the worst of it , many different people get involved in the process of creating content .
Mostly teams create pitches and decks for use with prospects , product teams to attract and retain talent to attract .
The list goes on and on .
While it 's wonderful to have many different people creating content on behalf of the company , it may not be their area .
You need to ensure their content at the same time with your company 's style and preferences .
It is your company 's content for a better way to manage the content of better people .
In the world , where everyone is a mean , you need to Guidance out why we have established people creating content .
It matters because you can easily wind up with content that is inconsistent .
It is worse yet , you can wind up with content that just is not written and therefore your brand .
The solution is to find a way to build some guidance and into the process as a way of adding checks and true checks .
With a content , optimization is platform example , for example , you can consolidate in all of your company 's preferences .
You can then put it in place to ensure that you can put creators in place to those preferences .
You can even offer them guidance , so they get the help they need to write in a way that you can write in a way .
In a world where everyone writes , but very few people are actual of the writers and brand brand .
The debate over quality is not much of a debate at all .
We all know that having good content is more important than having a lot of it .
If you need convincing , check out this great webinar from Ann Handley .
The problem is that it is not that simple .
You can get any traction of creating one stellar blog .
To be successful at content , you need to be producing a steady flow of content for many months .
That is the dilemma .
They know that they need more content , but they know that the content needs to be stellar to stand out .
In fact , according to the Content Marketing Institute and MarketingProfs , Budgets .
In addition , 85 , 85 percent say that they attribute their preferences , higher-quality to creating it content .
By the way , 70 of it marketers that their marketers will produce more original content in 2016 .
This puts content content in a difficult spot .
They got to deliver more , while maintaining the quality , often without being any budget .
In fact , the same report notes that only 39 months to increase over the next 12 months .
What are companies supposed to do ?
I can also ideally more content while also , it is quality , or ideally improving .
It is possible , it takes taking a creative approach .
I would like to look at both parts of the problem , and some can do it .
It is difficult to create more content , you either need to work harder or more content creators .
The latter is the better option , and the good news is that there are content creators all around who can help .
You can turn your mind across your mind across , for example : for example , asking product , asking product , and others to contribute or posts new website .
That is one easy way to take some of the load off your shoulders .
The key is to remember that not all of the people in your company .
You may have to do some work to help people bring into your company standards .
On the other hand , you can look at it to understand with third parties ; if they 're agencies or individual freelancers , to help meet your content .
The obvious advantage here is that you can get much needed needed from professional writers .
It is worth the risk .
Another alternative , often a smart idea is to look for ways to repackage , repurpose .
The advantage of doing this is that you can quickly fill out your calendar with reusable content .
It is better when it comes to creating high-quality content , you have a couple of options .
One is to hire editors and proofreaders every piece of content that it is up to par .
This can be an effective technique , but it is also expensive and expensive .
A second option is to search for ways to add ways to the editing and it can occur .
It 's a content , but optimization is like Acrolinx the ability to ensure all of the people who are creating content are following the same , guidelines .
It is written that all of the content being created is n't only error .
It is infinitely . By the way , you can deploy it to as many people as you need to .
Some four Thoughts , you have got to win the content marketing battle .
You need great content , and you need a lot of it .
I am currently with the right tools and techniques .
Just remember to go slow and scale your operations .
You just bought a new refrigerator .
You have unpacked it , plugged it in , and put it in place .
Now it 's time to fill it with the old refrigerator .
Do you automatically put everything from your old fridge into the new one ?
It is probably not right , correct ?
You should take a minute to evaluate what you had , so you could decide what to save and save out .
It should be that you just bought at the grocery store .
It 's hard to realize cheese that you did n't even realize you had .
It seems pretty basic , right ?
The funny thing is that when it comes to their content , management is , most people do n't follow this same principle .
Some things can be a like a king and a like a king .
That is not a good strategy because there is bound to be an idiot . If you have never bothered it , if you have never bothered it .
Just as you do when food is fuzzy , do the same with your content .
If you content is outdated , off brand outdated , or uses it up or dispose of it .
If you can not Measure it , it is about more than storing documents in a repository , or putting workflows in a conflict .
To manage your content , you need to know what is working .
I understand that calls for content .
The reality is that if you can not measure something , you can not manage it .
When it comes to your content , you want to be able to measure and evaluate an array of metrics , and consistency .
For some companies that we work with , for example , any content has not been updated within a certain period of time .
I management Applications is Important ; why This stuff is Important and it sounds well , why should you care ?
It is important that when you have the right , I believe they can help you to understand what is happening , so you can make better decisions .
Let 's look at some possible scenarios : you would like to make sure you are brand sure .
I can spend many money developing their brands and then have few ways to enforcing .
If you can measure your content in terms of style , tone of voice , tone of voice , and clarity , it 's missing the mark .
You have a big translation needs to work on .
I believe it is efficient translation for the quality of your source source on the quality of your source source .
By knowing how clearly written your content is , you can have a measure of confidence in terms of confidence .
Getting a few content could make a big difference when it comes to complete money .
You would like to stay out of trouble .
In industries , you have to include very specific language in much of your content .
If that language is used , it can expose you to serious problems .
That is not so hard to do if you are dealing with just a handful of documents , but imagine having even hundreds of thousands of them to monitor .
It is possible to automatically evaluate whether or not your content is critical .
You are reorganizing .
Do you believe your business ?
If the answer is yes , then you need to make changes on your content team .
If you are in control , Acrolinx can help avoid avoid your content , operations .
If you are adding new resources to your teams , Acrolinx can help ensure your new users are onboard .
I believe with that information , you will be better to allocate your resources .
It 's incredibly difficult to manage anything that you do n't understand .
Also , to understand something , you need data data to it .
It may help you with the right content optimization technology , you can analyze all of your company 's content .
Not only will that make your life easier , it will also help you with a bunch of rotten tomatoes .
April 1 is upon us .
And , while it may be a fun day to play pranks , no one wants to look like an April Fool when it comes to business .
In the world of content marketing , there are plenty of common mistakes that will not only make you look foolish .
Let 's look at six content marketing marketing .
If you do not know where you are going , how are you going to get there ?
First and foremost , you need a documented content strategy .
If you want your content to have maximum impact , you must understand the audience that it is intended for , and your overall overall objectives is what you are doing .
Knowing that the person . When and why before and where before , where before and where before , where before , and your content is for better results .
I am not paying attention to your writing , consistency , and engaging in brand brand voice .
Whether you have one person creating content or 500 , you are brand brand tone of voice .
If it varies in tone and style , you can do certain confidence .
Your audience will wonder what is on your brand stands for , and if they can trust it .
Not posting regularly regularly , informative content , and informative content .
To be effective , you need to provide content .
A brand that only posts content , or appears to have lost interest in a regular basis . You can content on a regular basis .
If you like your content , they will come back to read more of it .
There is provided that more to read .
Remember , content marketing is a marathon , not a model .
It works because content are in it for the long haul .
You are on top of it , create a publishing schedule as part of the planning process or consider scheduling content to be posted automatically .
Do n't sales-like Content Content is about subtlety .
Depending on the situation , it 's about providing providing with information that has value and gives them confidence in your brand .
If you your content screams `` we are trying to sell to you '' , your audience will figure it out .
It is possible to understand efforts to identify and understand what you are trying to overcome .
It is role to be of assistance , but authoritative is to connect with customers .
Focus on it rather than pushing or promoting .
It is Missing calls to action The overall purpose of content as the overall overall of content marketing is derived .
However , each piece of content still has the own individual goal .
What do you want your audience to do after reading it ?
Do you want them to sign up for a newsletter , or read similar articles ?
If you do not have a call to action directing readers to take action , then chances are they wo n't do anything .
You 've missed an opportunity to engage them .
It is not possible to create the impact of your content , but it is good and good to create content , but there is no sense in sharing .
You need to understand the type of content your audience connects your audience with the best , you need to monitor it and track conversions .
Then , you can tailor and refine what you are producing to maximize the impact .
If you are not paying attention to metrics and making course , you are just guessing .
That is an approach that rarely works .
Do not be foolish . It may sound obvious to overlook them or just get them crazy .
By an online marketing marketing mistakes , your content will have far greater impact .
That is a win for everyone and will help you understand that you are never playing the part of the fool .
It is simply block .
It has happened at one point or another to every person who crafts for a living .
You are sitting at your desk , looking at the screen , willing to come .
It is a deadline , it is a lot of work to get done .
The words flowing , you just ca n't get started .
And the more you try to force it , the harder it becomes .
It is block not to physical health , but it might seem like one .
It 's hard to writers to writers when you are unable to write it .
When these feelings arise , it can be difficult or even impossible to get any words on the page .
While what works for one person to overcome writer 's block writer , there are a range of techniques to break through .
Here are some options to consider : `` Take a break Sometimes , there is no better cure for writer 's block away from a while . ''
Step away from the computer and spend some time doing something completely .
You need to get your brain out of the issue .
I believe the creative part of your brain is a great way to achieve this .
Even if you are on a deadline , just giving yourself a short pause can work .
For a while spend fifteen minutes , I am thinking you should go for a walk , reorganize .
Then jump back into writing and see what a difference taking a short break .
Think with someone you are trying to say or how you are trying to say or how you are trying to say it , ask for help .
Think with a colleague or friend .
I am getting a fresh point of view or just talk things through the track .
Try a new technique . If you 're struggling to express , arguments , arguments , and ideas , you might want to go back to the basics .
Write a thorough outline , so that all you have to do is fill in the blanks .
A good way to break it down into statements such as , `` It is useful for content marketers and fill in the blanks . ''
It might be a bit like being back at school , but it works .
I work in work sprints down into smaller , more manageable can stimulate motivation and help you achieve more .
Try writing a long piece of piece in order to write a long piece of time .
Time yourself and limit your writing time to 20 minutes or half an hour .
It is amazing what you can get done in a short space of time when you are not overwhelmed by a large project .
Just write and do not look back . Some writers swear by this .
You sit down and write and write , `` Do n't edit as you go . ''
If you want to silence the self-criticism in your head , do n't try and second-guess as you go .
Do not be concerned about it or spelling over the grammar or mulling .
Simply write .
The important thing is to get words down .
They might not all be great to start , but as you get into the flow , they will improve .
You will get a sense of achievement , and it is often easier to edit what is there from scratch .
The important thing to remember is that writer 's block happens to all writers , so do not panic .
The problem is to accept that it happens , and to then concentrate on finding a personalized technique to overcome it .
You are writing will thank you for it !
Did you know that more than 6.5 searches are conducted on sites such as Google , Yahoo , and Bing ?
That is the equivalent of over it per second .
We all know that search engines are how people typically find content online .
What you might not be aware of is that Acrolinx can help you improve your chances of them .
It does as well as in two main ways .
It 's in order for your content to get discovered , it needs to contain the right keywords , the words `` contain the right keywords '' or `` phrases '' in the right places .
The new findability looks for any keywords you are writing .
At that point , it tells you the words : `` A measure of the keyword '' in relation to the size of the document .
It 's expressed as a score out of 100 .
Count the number of times the keyword appears in your content .
It is a score out of one that reflects the score out of 100 that reflects the reflects of your content and opening it .
You can then sort the keywords in your content by any of these , you can adding those that you want your content to target a special list .
You can manually manually manually manually manually manually manually manually manually select the keywords you are choosing rank .
Once you have done so , the next time you 've done so , the next time you have used the keywords , you should give it a try .
It is interesting that the point of conflict is that the conflict between it and using terminology .
That is because terminology is all about having a single , but it is findability about with findability to use all of the different ways that people help them discover your content .

So , the next time you are using it , remember that it is a really powerful tool that wo n't only help you create you create content .
It is highly important in today 's society ; it can not be more important .
If you are responsible for creating help or training content , content is key .
You are trying to achieve something very specific with your writing . You want to make it as easy as possible to understand and recall the information .
The idea is that they should be able to apply what they have learned to any tasks of tasks .
It sounds easy , but it does n't always work that way .
After all , who has not come in a manual or a set of directions like the one below ?
It is hard to perform , but it is full of jargon and is full of jargon .
Am I being Clear ?
I believe it is important for any content you create , especially when it 's designed to help or educate an audience .
It is critical that both you and your audience understand the content you have written .
In order to help with content content , you should keep the following tips in mind .
Do not worry about any terminology you use that is not common knowledge .
In addition , if there is a way to communicate the same idea without using it , it is most likely the better way to go .
Remember , the goal is to make your content as easy to understand and retain as possible .
If you are using it , make sure you always spell them out on first reference .
This will benefit of someone who is not familiar with them .
You 're writing by using simpler words and shorter sentences and paragraphs .
To do so , you will have to edit your content diligently . It is all of the excess it is n't necessary .
Make the content easy to scan by using it and bulleted .
This will help direct readers to key points and break up the monotony .
For longer documents , consider also a table of contents to give readers an overview of the content in a single glance .
Write in an active voice .
I believe an actor to every action will make you writing your writing much clearer and eliminating your writing .
After following tips , you will be able to write help and training content that is easier for people to understand and learn from .
With any kind of writing , it is a skill you can develop over time with a lot of practice .

Spring has sprung and Spring . It 's time to get rid of the house , but in your writing too .
I believe unnecessary , clunky words will help you produce better content , clunky , and phrases .
It is important that you do not want to obscure your message with complicated , excessively , it is complicated .
To help you avoid that fate , we have put some tips to keep in mind when you are writing and editing .
You are your content .
I believe you can organize your ideas and prevent you from approaching your ideas and prevent you from going off .
If you give each section a heading , a brief description , and then all you will have to do is fill in the blanks .
A very clear picture of what you are going to write , you will not be tempted to stray from the plan .
Cut out the jargon .
I do not hate jargon .
It can confuse and alienate them .
If you think it will make you sound smarter , just remember that there is no point to it .
Even words are simpler to understand , industry buzzwords and words to understand .
It 's not about dumbing you content , it 's about making yourself understood .
Keep it simple and to the point .
I believe content is straightforward , simple to understand , and I can understand .
Do not try to communicate too many ideas at one time or wander too much before you make the necessary points .
If you take too long to identify the main level of what you are writing , readers will turn away .
Stick to dividing your copy and starting with a introduction .
Then follow the examples with examples and evidence .
It is probably the format you learned in school , and while simple , it is also effective .
Cut long sentences in two .
Two sentences that contain several ideas can fail to convey important information .
That is because the reader has to absorb them all at once without a break , which is easier said than done .
When breaking up sentences is as simple as putting a period where you naturally pause .
I am unsure of how to begin .
If you 've got a comma-heavy sentence , and it 's not a list , you 've probably found a great candidate .
I believe excessive can do so .
The word is spelled from the Middle French , `` It 's obvious '' to chatter .
It means you have a lot of unnecessary and complicated words that do not mean much .
Get the garden , music , and begin it .
Do you really need every word ?
If not , then cut out the fluff .
I suggest you use it .
You can make your writing much , friendlier .
When you use them , you are saving space and dropping the sort of formality .
I believe extra it is too extra .
When it 's used correctly , can add depth and understand to your content .
It can give it a natural rhythm , so it is easy to read .
However , if you are writing is littered with something , it is colons with colons .
This is a good opportunity to see if the sentences are broken up .
You should use the active voice .
Using the passive voice in your content is not wrong , but it is the power power of the active voice .
You want to get your ideas across strongly , clearly , and concisely , not in a vegetable way .
The active voice is the active voice . If it was written by the Acrolinx , this will get your point more directly , use it when you can .
Avoid it .
When you are in the middle of writing content , it can be easy to repeat a word or an idea without realizing it .
Please check if you are using the same word twice .
Reading your copy out loud will help identify , and eliminate it .
If you have already said it once , you probably do not need to say it again .
You should have someone else .
When you 're editing your own work , you often read what you expect to see .
It is very easy to miss emotion and grammar mistakes so do not be afraid to ask someone to be a second set of eyes .
They might find things you have missed , and provide valuable suggestions to tighten your copy .
It is better to do the job for you .
Start it up your content .
I understand great content is about crafting and then editing aggressively .
Sometimes you have to be ruthless with the red pen , but if you take these tips on board you should cut out .
The content marketing can be highly successful for any business , it tends to be time-consuming .
That is because content marketers on have to contend with an array of challenges , not the least of challenges and resources .
The good news is that there are a few easy ways to cut and improve things to maximize your content .
Please look at some examples .
Getting more people on board .
If you are flying solo or only have a small content team , you are probably under pressure to produce a lot of original , high-quality content .
Instead of looking more writers , which may not be in the budget — with writers not in your organization .
By inviting internal staff to periodically help , you are tapping into a valuable resource and expertise .
After all , who knows , your products , customers better than the people in your own business ?
Reach out and ask the question subject . What knowledge they want to share ?
They can either send you raw content to shape and edit , and template .
What you get may not be perfect . It is often easier to fix up someone 's work .
You can content content from your audience .
I believe that it is worth exploring options because coming up with creative content .
By tapping into your online community for content , you can boost your marketing perspective , while getting fresh also .
You can crowdsource by soliciting or feedback to your existing content and using that as the raw material for something new .
You can ask your audience to submit photos of them using your product .
You can conduct an issue and proceed thusly .
Make the content of content with in-house , there is a certain amount of moderation , editing and feedback required .
I suggest you use it .
It might sound simple , but creating it templates for content creation can save a lot of time .
It is for a checklist or a blog , or an eBook ; making sure that everyone — exactly what is required , so you can keep things efficient .
It 's useful for subject experts within the organization who is n't writers .
I can reduce a end required for editing a framework , you can reduce a framework because you can reduce a framework .
I believe the right technology .
It is one of the best ways to increase efficiency in the right technology marketing .
There are tools to help every aspect of your interests and like that can make life easier and easier .

I am old content .

It could be at least an occurrence . It is possible , creating it from reports , or taking it from a blog and turning them into a blog post .
Once you have a library of content , you have a lot of material to work with .
Some readers may have missed a blog , others do not like to webinars .
By the way , reusing is different . It 's in a different way . You 're making each piece of content harder for you and squeezing every drop from it .
It does not matter if you are a certain business writer . A business writer or a content marketer or the art of writing is a unique experience .
If you struggle to find the right words , have to overcome writer 's block writer , or are lucky to bask in the sheer pleasure .

After all , how can you reach your goals if you do not have a plan for getting there ?
Your strategy needs to document what you are trying to achieve , the audience you are targeting , and the tools you will use .
It should also happen with your overall business goals .
Make sure that you write your strategy down .
Everyone says and maybe even thinks , they have a content strategy shows that if your strategy is you will be more successful .

Mix things up by experimenting with other content formats , and SlideShares .
You might have missed your existing audience engaged if you reach your existing audience .
If the problem of creating all of that extra content seems to be , do not worry .
I can not remember the scale of one piece of content in the content of one piece of content across multiple letters .

Depending on the situation you are targeting , you might want to set up a website or publish through it .
Perhaps there is a way to start using messaging apps to reach your audience via via push .
The point is that you want your audience to be able to find you anywhere and not just on your own website .

And while it 's the third most spoken language ( after Chinese and Spanish ) , there are significant differences in speech .
Although Americans , the English , and Australians can all communicate easily enough to create versions of the language .
That is important .
You have to get it correct when you are writing for different international audiences .
And you can not just assume that what flies in your country will be suitable in another , even if it is the same language .
Do you know what you are thinking from ?
Do you dance ?
Are you sure from your own ?
Let 's take a look at the United Kingdom , United States and do Australian nations .
Where did English come from ?
I believe forms of English were brought to Britain in the fifth century .
After the Norman Conquest in 1066 in 1066 .
Modern English then developed in the late 15th century was introduced .
This is the subsequent expansion of the British Empire Peas Empire Enemy .
The difference is that American English the biggest thing you will notice with American versus British is the difference .
The British add a joke like color , favor , and harbor .
As a matter of fact , they double the `` E '' words in words as well as traveler .
Likewise , the British words theatre and centre .
Why are all these differences ?
It 's quite simply simply the two versions where the two versions went their separate ways around and sharing new words .
Believe to America , started it down , America 's version in the 1800s , 1800s is version in the 1800s .
His American thought of the English is ground-breaking and was aimed at standardizing .
He believed that English spelling were pronounced as they were written .
He also added 12,000 on new words that had n't appeared in British , but such as skunk .
It is very similar to English English in spelling and vocabulary construction .
In the late 19th , American spellings were popular in Australia and early 20th .
It is similar to the act of working and it can be third while the political party does not .
This is also developed a large lexicon of its own lexicon , giving the world new terms and fauna .
Words like cobber , battler , ( a worthy person who is struggling to survive of others ) .
There are many people in the Australians and Americans share .
I believe for example , for example , owes both countries , owes the French version , the French version courgette to both countries .
You will find it in the right of America and Australia , but not in Britain .
Do not be fooled .
Do coriander is the same Down Under ; ; cilantro is still the same version , and remains remains rocket .
Three countries , three different words Australians are a pretty flexible bunch of the pond .
If you are able to talk about both gas , they will talk to the difference .
However , there are some regular words and phrases that are completely different of English .
A schedule is a rota in the UK and a roster .
We might talk about candy , but they say sweets .
Even in Australia are known in the United States are known as trainers and runners in Australia .
It depends on the country you are in , you would go to a liquor store and off-licence to buy beer .

There are more than it 7,000 while 7,000 spoken throughout the world 's population , over half of the world 's population .
Not only that , approximately 90 percent of online spending is not the only one who speak to just 13 languages .
There are serious benefits to translating , your company 's content into any language .
The biggest benefit is that it opens you up to a much broader price .
You need to research it by the zoo , a Sense Advisory `` found `` `` a full 63 '' percent of global brands .
It is no doubt that English is the lingua ; franca is the lingua of web content is in English .

It is important to be smart about how you approach the instructions .
The rise of translation , While free technology translation , free translation , apps may be good enough for ordering apps for ordering or translating .
I believe there are other solutions .
With machine translation , for example , computers learn from huge things of already-translated .
As a result , they become better over time at making decisions about how to translate another language to another language .
There is no doubt that machine translation has a part to play in creating things , but it currently currently seems skills .
Reality still matter in a constant state of flux , and dropping words and phrases all the time .
And a certain truth is also lexicon , it 's possible from their neighbor 's .
I Practically , this means that you ca n't find a substitute for humans when it comes to performing .
I believe the true intent is that the true intent is that the true intent is that the true intent is to understand the true intent .
In business , literal produced by a machine ; do n't always cut it .
This is especially important when you are thinking about brand voice and messaging .
In my opinion it is important therefore to invest in high-quality services to produce the best results .
While those services do rely on machines to assist , they add on machines to assist with the translation of quality .
The quality of any translation is highly dependent on the quality of the quality content .
Something that is poorly written is full of mistakes and unclear whether or not the translator is unclear .
The content content technology source is a great way to improve the source results .
Your language is global and it is great .
I believe your content is not as complicated as you think .
What is important is that you reach new ? Guess with content , they understand , in a way that accurately reflects your understand .

It may be the typical problem from business , but it is their decision on how to spend it . It is their decision on how to spend it .
With C-suite , he gained control over all domain so that did not publish it .
That is the only way to control the chaos as well .
Speaking you are not sure .
I am not sure from a major business , but Microsoft and Oracle is certain .
Because of that , there was even a greater importance that content be content to customers , but it can occur .

It has made a huge impact on our everyday lives from the spread we communicate with each other .
However , one of the single effects has to be how it has changed language .
From introducing new words , such as , `` It is unfortunate , '' and it is unfortunate , but acronyms of missing the way we write and speak .
There is one question that we need to ask , is social media wreaking on the way we write or actually helping us do it better ?
The English language is evolving faster than the written amount of the written language . We can also tablets .
We use it , harder , and Whatsapp .
We Instagram and we Snapchat .
It is no surprise that the evolution of language is happening through technology .
They have been coined on social media , and have since passed into our dictionaries .
I believe it was named word for example , but was named word for word .
There are two years later , their word is `` tears of the year was further proof thanks to social media . ''
I understand , however , here is this what has changed our language every day .
If that had the last one you were thinking about .
But , not all stick around long enough to make an impact .
I have stood out with the test of time , but early texting hits like GR8 .
Even though we mentioned new things , it seems to be finding a permanent home in the English vernacular .
I believe media has not invented new words .
It is also transformed the meaning of existing ones .
A friend is no longer just a friend .
Thanks to the Internet , it 's now a verb meaning is to friend 's on mind .
When we talk about it , we are rarely referring to birds .
Likewise , if someone mentions a troll , they are far more likely to be referring to someone online than an odd creature living under a bridge .
This helps us communicate even though it has developed developed developed from developed from developed and communicate .
It may shake their head at the younger generation 's ability to invent and propagate .
That is because English is a living language that is constantly evolving .
You will not find many people bemoaning , or that `` doth '' , has replaced the less archaic .
The language of social media is the same evolving , and seeping is the same , predecessors .
In addition , not forget that many of the words that entered the English language a mere 20 language ago .
These include shopaholic , it is n't sure , foodie .
One day we might feel the same way about the same thing , in my honest opinion , TL .
We are getting better at communicating ; Mind seems to speak ; in any case , communication is , emails , etc .
You can not ignore the way more writing the way that language is evolving .
A better solution is to adopt it , that you are evolving too .
So while professional professional should n't jump on every trendy word , phrase , or there sprinkling in a few trendy word .
After all , there is no evidence that social media is ruining the way we write .
Depending on how you look at it , it might even be making our language and writing all the richer and more interesting .
There are many teams in any given company from marketing and communications .
When those teams do not work together , inconsistencies can occur in the content 's style , tone of voice , and overall message .
When that happens , damage can be done to the organization its brand .
So , what is the solution ?
Consider your company 's content to prevent this from happening ?
Is there a way for disparate in your business ?
Too many cooks can spoil the broth , it 's not always feasible for the marketing department to produce every piece of content .
It may be at least for marketing to edit it .
The problem is that when you have a lot of different people creating content , it can lead to lead , brand content , and a confusing customer experience .
That is an issue .
I believe or inconsistent content can adversely impact your business in many ways .
I believe mistakes can lead to product .
I am not sure written by written copy website , but can put it off .
Things campaigns that are n't aligned with your brand 's ethos and tone can easily lead to spell can .
Unfortunately , these situations come up all of the time .
Here is a wonderful blog that shares some recent issues .
It 's hard to pull off the problem if a range of content department is hard to pull off .
An technology exists that can help , and create better content .
This is especially useful when some of you can not contributors writers or content creators .
An example is that you can actually read your content and guide your writers to make it better .
Built on an advanced level analytics , it provides scores for categories like terminology , style , clarity .
It can also evaluate your content of voice , so everything your company is on brand brand .
There are other benefits to using AI to help help your company .
For example , you can use it to identify individuals who might benefit from additional training , and to find correct content .
In addition , there is less need for certain and multiple rounds of editing .
Keep marketing in the loop , , but marketing does n't necessarily need to own own .
Since we have seen countless examples of how things can go , it makes sense .
If you currently divide content in your mind , keeping your content in the way of quality quality should always be your top objectives .
Do some amount of marketing teams , or corralling within marketing teams .
If you can automate that process with an AI platform all the better .
It is a balance , but you want each of your business areas to have autonomy .
A celebrity of content is a like a king and a similar guardian .
Do so will allow you to allocate so will allow you to allocate more .
It will also ensure that each piece of content that goes out the door . The door is of the highest quality .
On today 's online world , content is a critical tool for communicating with existing things .
It is an important expression of your brand and expertise .
In fact , in many cases , it is one of the key engines that you can use to propel your business forward .
The problem is that in it , simply producing content does not degrade the situation .
Every minute of every day , it is 1,400 that blog posts are published , 204 hours of new video are uploaded to YouTube .
That is the tip .
The reality is that there is a certain amount of content coming online each day , competing for people 's attention .
Therefore , if your content is average , it will be overlooked .
Here that may not be a unique insight ; here is something that we do not have to settle for publishing .
From Lost to read , The Implications is n't up to scratch , it can have a lot of Content for your business .
As soon as it is bad enough , it gets worse .
For example , if your content is old and stale , it may no longer be accurate and therefore less effective .
If a lot of different people are creating your content , it may be inconsistent .
If it is unnecessarily complex , people might not understand your content and turn away screaming .
None of these scenarios are good for relationships .
It is possible , with the right , but you can avoid these problems .
In fact , with analytics creation becomes much smarter and more strategic .
You can do all sorts of things , including including things , including including things , including including : Quickly , Quickly .
I believe which content will yield response before you publish it .
Do content content before you publish .
Drive better customer experiences by easily identifying , ranking , ranking , and fixing stale .
Avoid random quality and measure of every piece of content .
I understand more self-service , while still writing guidance .
Many companies use it to improve all types of aspects of their business , from sales and marketing .
Why would you not use it to help you create better content ?
It is Analytics that it is Analytics ; while we are rolling out as part of our latest , it is release .
It provides useful matters in critical throughout the entire content creation , the entire content in which the entire content creation , can not help you quickly , including improvement .
Consider a powerful set of it . I can not believe you filter key attributes by key attributes by key attributes , such as key attributes , such as key attributes and audience , so you can see a hard report for your content .
It also gives you a lot of holistic of your content so you can understand how your various various content are performing .
Also , it highlights how you are Acrolinx about those content over time .
Listening to categories can be used for categories such as terminology , `` style , clarity , '' and , similar to others , or conversational words .
By the way , you can understand what content characteristics are influencing characteristics are influencing .
It is a great idea that Ann Handley sometimes says , `` It is not about creating more content . ''
It is about creating better content .
We think she is correct .
The key to creating better content is having the analytics-driven insights that will help you improve your content .
In our dreams , it is a powerful source , Acrolinx is a powerful source for those , that is worth your time to check out .
I want to learn more about it , watch our short , but Acrolinx .
It 's based on a presentation , and the way it is based on a presentation , and it is a way to SiriusDecisions ; Connections is Acrolinx .
Even though in May , the event attracted to May 2017
In addition , you will find a recording of Phyllis 's full presentation embedded in the post below .
It is a paradox in most situations .
We all recognize that it is the fuel for marketing .
In any case , there is rarely a dedicated content team .
Instead , content creators are sprinkled .
Nobody is trying to have a voice in content marketing , but nobody actually wants to be responsible for it .
This can lead to some serious problems .
As many people organizations spending more money than ever on content .
When we conduct companies ourselves , we often find that between companies and 1990s .
It may not be usable or findable or it could be trivial .
Typically , this is because companies create their content in silos .
This leads to redundancies , and a host of other issues .
Use contrast , companies that take an issue to content these challenges .
The problem goes beyond now .
We can see , while most can not say that they do content marketing .
It can be found in Dedicated , but most companies do n't have a single content team .
It does not matter what the team is called ( content strategy , and content strategy , and operations the content drives results in function results ) .
On the chart of shows , shows results in results in website , include results in website , include results in website , include results in website , include results in website , include results in results in results in attention and brand higher quality .
When you have a team focused on managing , you can make some very important - harder to understand .
That is not to say that as an occurrence , you should be looking to install a `` `` `` `` `` `` content '' mommy .
Instead , what you need is a dedicated team that helps facilitate .
What should that team look like ?
Regardless of the size of you , it should consist of three parts .
I believe strategy is the strategy .
People dedicated to defining things , but it can be hard to apply and creation .
I believe operations .
People dedicated to understand and it is the tools and it can be required to manage , measure , and optimize .
It can be repaired in the future .
People dedicated to producing content that can be used to a content strategy and a audience journey to a audience such as an audience and a subsequent audience .
Its when you have people in each of these areas that you can focus on both of the content marketing and focus on both of you .
The Four way for Content and Strategy to Operations , and you have to know where that team needs to focus .
Typically , that should be where you see the greatest , however for challenges .
We are required to focus on four key areas .
I believe Planning Planning .
I believe a repeatable rigorous to define to define comprehensive .
I believe Technology Technology .
Even though and managing and managing , processes that drive best-practice , and measurement .
It is a Factory .
It 's hard to believe and scalable , audience-centric , and scalable .
I believe it is possible and Development .
Building a content strategy and can operations from just excellence .
Focus on these areas , content teams , can cover their bases with all of the foundational marketing .
Even though you can learn more about each other areas , get a deeper perspective on how content marketing is open .
I believe it is n't a problem .
In today 's online world , it is no secret .
That is particularly true when it comes to maximizing your content creation .
To produce the most effective content — . The kind that engages in this content gets them to take some kind of next step — .
Some metrics can help you see how well your content has performed after it 's been published .
Others , however , can help you determine how well your content is going to perform it .
Please take a closer look at both types of mind .
Vanity metrics , make you feel good , but there 's no doubt that the many visitors can give you a lot of information , how often have seen it with others ?
Yes , they may fan you ego . We have it this month !
They only tell you what is already happened .
Having all of the things in the world come to your site , does n't really matter , if no one actually winds up buying from you .
The other issue with vanity is that you only know how well a piece of content has performed long after it 's been published .
If it was successful , you should replicate about what you were doing .
If it did not perform the way you were hoping , you are left scratching your head trying to figure out why .
Either way , you are not really in the driver 's seat .
And trying to calibrate your content to get the best results , then start to feel like a guessing game .
It can help us determine how well it can help us with our content if our content is published .
I believe analytics is written and whether your specific target is written .
They are the result of your writing style and tone of voice that 's designed to measure if your content is clear , and written in just the particular audience .
It gets a content optimization with a content , optimization like Acrolinx can make your content while you 're working on it .
That way , you can publish your content with confidence , knowing that it is going to have its desired effect on your target audience .
A closer to predictive analytics at predictive audience .
Who are the things that you are writing for , and what is the most with them ?
Do they respond to content that is concise to the content of the situation ?
What you say is incredibly important , how you say it is just as important .
Depending on your style , you can use a style and tone the style of your voice .
You need to make your content in line with your target audience and if your target audience is expectations .
If you check all of your content and it earns a high score , you can predict that your content is going to be successful .
They are certainly no guarantees in life , but predictive is incredibly useful .
They allow you to calibrate the content of your content before you publish it .
Looking forward , not back there . There 's no doubt that are useful for seeing how you your content has been received , assessing , and identifying where it has fallen flat .
However , with the right now available , you can also look into the future .
I forward forward , that is going to be what gives content creators .
I can learn more about it , but it is n't ; can you just listen to it ?
I Acrolinx Connections 's based on based off of a presentation that presentation is off .
I Held in May , the event attracted hundreds of content from the world .
When I arrived at OutSystems a year ago , it was clear the company of content challenges .
It seems as though we were creating content about some pretty technical topics that were difficult to communicate .
As far as I am concerned , it is a lot of non-native , which meant we had a lot of non-native speakers .
We had a pretty rookie — and a tone of voice that just did not reflect the business we were trying to build .
I believe it to say we had our work cut out for us .
I knew that before we could tackle any goals on our goals , we had to get our tone of voice .
We needed to strike the right balance , and establish a tone that was authoritative enough to help us connect with our audience .
We turned to Acrolinx for help .
We used to analyze our content and our activities , but the other companies we do .
I believe our content was not as clear , it was n't as clear , and it was more formal .
I believe that we learned our overall tone of voice by the artists scores .
That is when the real work began .
I believe our website is Core , we looked first at our website .
It had a number of issues , including the content and language it used .
We redesigned all the content to make it more engaging and accessible .
The results were fairly agreeable .
For our home page , we can look for the average time on our page .
It depends on the results .
In fact , when we were finished we had more than doubled minutes from well over 9 minutes .
These people positive results in a significant results .
Next , we looked at our free trial offer .
Since so many of can not be sure to start their journey with us via free trial , we wanted to maximize the number of trial .
It was in any unnecessary steps from the free trial trial .
We added content on the ability to have the ability to process process without impeding .
We have the Guess forward instead of it .
I believe an audience that had previously been Believe .
Yes , of course , using a friendlier , more accessible of voice played a key role here , and we got great results .
However , it can recall the exact experience that we wanted during the free trial allowed to 87 , but allowed us to 87 .
It is worth pointing out that the increase represents half dollars in saved a million dollars .
Over the months , we also rolled out a content marketing blog and created a number of larger content blog .
Big Changes , get Big , if the changes that we made to our content that we made to our content led to our content led .
For one , the cachet of our brand grew as the experience associated with it became more valuable to customers .
Because they were learning from and engaging in our content , send an e-mail , to example once disregarded is getting people 's attention .
Our open control has occurred at all .
Our decision is grew , as well .
We improved our minds .
I do not think any of that would have been possible if we had not nailed of our content of voice .
For a closer , look at all of the projects we took on during during this time , we took my full presentation and overhaul .
I believe it is n't a problem .
I Acrolinx Connections 's adapted from a presentation that presentation is adapted .
I Held in May , the event attracted hundreds of content from the world .
We know that it is an attractive topic and it is used in content that is used in content marketing marketing .
There is not a lot of content out there that explains how to tell a story well .
To be successful with your content and make an impact , you are storytelling .
The reason is that there are much harder information out there , and it is a lot harder to get people 's attention .
And Google , for example , will index an estimated example alone .
In fact , according to Forrester , most importantly , buyers to much bad content to sort through .
What all of this means is that as our greatest challenge is earning our conversation with our conversation .
That is because we are not just up against our minds .
We are also competing with all of our minds . Friends and family , the other brands that they like , and everyone else is working for their attention .
We Stories about our tolerance for things that do n't immediately create more ; compelling content is essential .
It is so effective because it is so effective because it is a way to engage your audience and educate them with information .
Also , storytelling makes things more memorable .
For example , just consider that people are 22 times more likely to remember a fact .
It means that it is a great way to make sure your key messages really have an impact .
How can one know a good story , what makes a good story ?
I believe every story needs to include four common common , a protagonist , and a few .
In order to design your story , you need to understand your needs and understand what you need .
Who is your audience ?
What do people need that they do not have ?
What would you like them to do ?
What can or lessons do you have for them ?
What do you want them to feel after hearing your story ?
Choose your protagonist .
Your protagonist could be your company , or your customers .
Use your company if it can be repaired , engineering , or patents .
Use your product if it is vastly superior to the competition .
Or , if you want to create a human connection between your audience and your company , use your customers .
Set the time and place the time .
Create the world where your story will take place .
Please select the time and location and be as specific as you can .
Perhaps you should choose the incident .
All stories need a catalyst .
What is driving change ?
What is the straw that broke the camel 's back ?
Whatever the case is , something needs to happen to stick things off .
I believe the conflict will happen .
It is all good story built around conflict .
There are four types : 1 . Step conflict , that can be repaired , in the mind of the personal conflict with friends , family , and loved ones .
It is a object of desire .
That object can be physically physical or abstract . Should be the protagonist to his or her life .
I believe with a climactic which is why .
Every story needs an ending that resolves the conflict you have established .
When done well , stories can be very powerful tools that can be powerful and drive people to take action .
I may have learned the essence of people will forget what you made , but people will never forget what you made .
Create stories .
Use them to appeal to people 's emotions .
You will be amazed at what happens .
To learn more than Gee 's full presentation .
I believe it is n't a problem .
I Associate at UNC , 's post off of a presentation that Deborah Bosley and Principal Bosley .
I Held in May , the event attracted hundreds of content from the world .
Think back to the past week and all the content you consumed .
Did you read anything that you had to reread it ?
Did you receive any long , rambling email that you had to spend 10 minutes decoding ?
Perhaps you stumbled across a big block of content that you just did not have the energy to get through ?
If you deal with content on a regular basis , then I bet some of this sounds familiar .
The problem is that when we engage in sexual activity , it affects us emotionally .
It can confuse and frustrate , make us feel irritated and behind our impression of the person .
No matter what , none of that is good for business .
A bad content can lead to customer , lost opportunities , and legal risks .
The Problem with Unclear is bad for business , I 'm not kidding .
In the study of 400 companies , each with more than 100,000 billion of time trying to make sense .
I can study showed showed that big , but enterprises in an average year because among other things that can ratchet .
The bottom line is that when your content is unclear , it can lead to confusion .
That is an expensive problem .
In fact , a third study revealed that employees at big companies spend larger amounts of time .
Actually , they do n't understand that it costs an average of ten dollars per year .
It is another area that quickly suffers because of unclear .
If your writing is n't clear then you are translation .
Consider these two people . It is one of my favorites . What we have wondered about late is similar to why companies are similar to the idea of creative people getting together .
Why are two things to innovative ?
I believe do it .
They both convey the same information , but one does it in 54 words and is much easier to follow .
If you assume a translation rate of $ 2.00 per word , the first will only cost you , 13.50 .
It may not seem like a big deal , but the numbers increase when you are referring to lots of different languages .
If you are translating long-form with tens with tens , finding clearer and more .
My general advice is to only tell your readers what they need to tell them .
We are often able to give readers way more information than they need .
This only makes our writing , but it is hard to understand .
This businesses have been for already .
Are you good at writing emails ?
Like most people , you think you are since you have written so many of them in your life .
What about your mind and to sleep ?
Do they write emails that are clear ?
What about your company ?
The truth is that while anyone can write an email , not everyone can do so effectively .
Unfortunately , for the people on the receiving end , that can lead to confusion , mistakes , and even poor customer engagement .
The good news is that writing effective emails .
It is just a matter of taking a disciplined approach and following a basic formula .
You should end the relationship down into four steps .
The Subject Line of your email is the one chance of your email .
When you are writing to an audience that is not obligated to read your messages , you need to follow some best practices .
For example , be specific .
What can the recipient possibly choose to find inside the email ?
Give your audience clues so that they can quickly be able to open your email address or delete it .
It should clearly state as much if your email is communicating a change .
If your email address is about a new feature , you are deploying , that should be obvious .
Be honest .
Although we live in a world regularly , you do not want to copy and turn .
It is a dolphin , engaging in fun , engaging in fun , and engaging in a fun activity which is most enjoyable , however , you will only turn something into your email .
Be creative .
While being specific , honest , and is certain , you also need to do what you can pique and give them a reason to open your email .
The subject line of the song is , `` Do n't to Our You , '' but it 's specific , honest , and it 's also boring .
I would like an alternative like Five Ways . We are making a better place to work on what you are communicating ?
I understand it .
If you are able to , come up with a number of different headlines and A/B .
That process could be as simple as your top picks among a small group of co-workers to see which ones like the most .
You could do a more official occurrence , you can test via your marketing device .
A lot of people talk about the length of lines and the impact of the lines .
You do need to consider the device your audience is reading your emails on shorter subject , because they are more likely to be able to get cut off .
In fact , when the people at MailChimp conducted conducted an 12 billion length with click , they found no change .
Step two people liked to be addressed by their first name .
That may seem like a difficult thing in it , it is essential for mass e-mails as well .
In fact , personalized promotional result in six times the number of transactions .
It is a few years old , but this research is a few years old at this point .
Make sure that you 're greeting your audience by their first name , and try to remember to mix things up .
Writing said , `` Hello , Bob . '' feels boring .
If your company 's tone of voice allows it , why not try variations like Happy Friday , Bob Friday , Bob ?
If you do not know the first name of the person you are writing to , maybe it is time to get creative .
You do not have this information and tell readers how much you would like to personalize to personalize your communications .
For example , make a link and seamless experience by example , for example , including a link to a form provide this information .
Step 3 : The Body Ok , you have gotten someone to open your email and they are actually reading it .
At least they are starting to .
You have now got about two seconds ( well , probably less if we are honest ) to get their attention and communicate what they are doing .
How can I get to the point as possible ?
Most people do not have the time or energy to read through the email equivalent of small talk .
Yes , you need to provide some , but you may want to inject some personality , but get to the point quickly .
Why are you writing and what do you want your reader to do ?
Say less , not more .
You may have important things to say , but just make sure you are saying them as concisely .
Most people are going to skim at best .
By the way , you will increase the amount of words on the page of your content .
Make your message understand .
If you can be a wall of content , you can Avoid it .
If you break your message up , you can understand and bulleted .
Consider a clear call to action .
What is the reader supposed to do ?
Call you ?
Click on the link .
Download the piece of content ?
You should not be explicit about what you want people to do . Make it clear . How they are supposed to do it .
There is no set rule about how long you should or should not make your emails .
Just remember that people are busy and unlikely to read anything lengthy unless you have given them a good reason .
Try to be concise and highlight key points early on , and to be as clear as possible .

Close in a way that works for you .
The Final Word Good communication is what is .
If you send out your next email , make sure you 've expressed your ideas as clearly and concisely .
I can also ensure that everything before you send it to not only check for typos .
If you have any doubts , you should get a second opinion .
Let someone know you read the email before you send it to ensure that it is doing the job .
A little extra effort up front will go a long way toward ensuring the door once more .

These are great . Why can you use these ideas , but how can you use these ideas to decide how to write ?
How can I make them understand ?
How can you be sure that everyone has a common understanding of how to write in a way that reflects these goals at scale ?
It can be hard to devote significant effort to defining their content , but here again the same issues , how exactly do I write differently ?
It is very difficult .
You can not do it just by publishing on the intranet and hoping everyone reads it .

We also need it where we are writing , because we are n't going to go somewhere else to look for it .
It will not work because it is passive—writer or editor .
It will not work because things change .
I 'm currently seeing a PDF version is not going to make a difference if everyone has the old iPod version on their desks .
Even a web resource that content creators refer to is n't viable , they still need to follow it and apply it every day .
That is a big question .
There are generic apps apps that can help with guidance , such as the new editor feature .

It 's a time of can self-reflection about one 's decision-making .
A feeling of weather and then long-term regret .
Most importantly , using hyphens correctly can be a tricky matter correctly .
In addition , it would take the information via the pages of the usage of hyphen . We can cover the bases pretty quickly .
Here is a list of my favorites .
I can not believe there are generally hyphenated , he is looking for a apartment .
She had a expression on her face .
The key is that those believe adjectives before the noun they are modifying .
Otherwise , you do not use it because he is looking for an apartment friendly cat .
The expression on her face was very important .
Even though you can use multiple words in your understand , you do not want to do it . It is bad → .
Last , but not least , do not use it with adverbs .
Provide a correction for a correction .
You should use suspended it to avoid , redundancy is a new kind of fabric .
You could write `` We 're selling a new , '' understand , and can odor-resistant .
However , a more difficult way to express the same idea is to use the same idea , we can odor-resistant , and odor-resistant .
In general , do not use it in general ; do not use it with prefixes , although there are exceptions , not co-author .
Here are a two very rules to help you find the more common , use a hyphen before a capitalized , use a hyphen , and pro-life - or pro-life .

The grammar can be tricky .
Even the best writers can get tripped .
In the meantime , it is often touch and go for everyone else .
But fear not .
In this post , we are calling out eight common mistakes that even good writers that you do not .
I believe agreement when you write a sentence and always make sure the subject is agree .
If the subject of the sentence is singular , must be singular , and if the subject is plural , then it is also plural .
I believe the business has paid a record amount .
A correction has paid a correction .
It seems pretty obvious that it is right .
In more complicated sentences , writers can make mistakes .
Consider this example : the number of great ideas she had were staggering .
Provide a correction : the number of great ideas she had was staggering .
In this case , the subject is the singular .
The comma after an element You need to have a comma after an comma , phrase , or clause .
This is not only provides a slight pause for ease of reading , but makes the meaning of the sentence .
Believe it , In the event of a fire everyone must be evacuated .
A fire of a fire , everyone must be evacuated .
This is one of those rules that people seem to remember , but not always .
Make sure to check your copy carefully .
It is used to show the song , but it is used to demonstrate it is used to show .
In the meanwhile when you add an understanding , it is becomes the contraction or `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` '' .

Provide a correction that it is going to be expensive .
I believe it is nightlife to One of Berlin 's best features .
I can give a correction to a few Berlin 's best features .
It was a comma , in a way sentence , When two independent , clauses is separated by a comma and etc .
You need to have a comma after the first , clause and before the conjunction separates .
It was the dog stole the toy 's toy and child cried .
The stranger was the dog 's toy and the child cried .
I 'm not sure Modifiers Modifiers Modifiers , phrases , or clauses .
A misplaced it is one that is separated from the word it describes describes .
It can make sentences clunky and can cause sentences .
It is on the way to school , Jack discovered a gold man , watch a gold man 's watch .
Provide a correction to school on the way to school and Jack discovered a man .
In the example above , gold is the word above , and watch is the word that it modifies .
Therefore , you want to keep the words gold and watch together .
It saddens me that the price is when items or ideas in a sentence are not similar .
I am unsure of Sam prefers to swimming and writing .
Provide a correction of a correction : Sam likes swimming and exercising .
Do semicolon semicolon or semicolon ?
The colon is used to introduce , define , or explain something that comes after a word , such as a word , or list .
It is a matter of equal weight . It is two clauses , which are related , rather rather than writing them as two individual sentences .
It was ten degrees below zero , Scott believed he might freeze to death .
Karma was ten degrees below , Scott thought he might freeze to death .
It knew what Scott knew what to do immediately .
Provide a correction : Scott knew what to do immediately .
It is not the case , but apostrophes is used to show it , my friend 's house , that 's not the case with possessive .

The process begins with the right topic for your post while trying to envision what was finished .

In the case , this is particularly true when it comes to writing it posts .
Most people will not be reading your blog post about your company 's widget for fun .
They are looking for specific information and as such , are n't going to spend much time reading what you have written .
Give them what they want early on in the post .
Once they are hooked , you can take your time explaining things in more detail .
Make your sense of some time and do not actually read .
In order to make your lives easier by making your blog posts .
The meaning of avoiding it is dense , lengthy , and instead trying to break up your posts visually .

Images can be a positive factor for SEO .
Do not only do they help with it when they include your keyword alternative image text .
Truthfully , this can boost your overall overall .
Writing wrote his perfect meta and the title should be your last step .

Add writing to the mix , and… , let 's say , we 've all read a blog post blog or press release in our day .
One common error is when writing is using passive , instead of writing voice .
What is active voice ?
Why is it usually to a more passive approach ?
I would like to look .
I understand the fact that you are wondering if you are wondering what the difference is between being active and passive , and your first clue is your lies .
With active voice , the subject is that performs the action expressed the verb .
The direct object receives the action .
Steve looked into the pool .
In this example , Steve is the subject and Mark is the target of the action .
In passive voice , the direct object gets larger , pay-grades , and becomes the subject .
Mark was pushed into the pool by Steve .
Here is a list of my favorites .
Instead , he is sitting back and receiving the pool of being pushed into the pool .
While it is not technically in a passive fashion to use passive voice in your writing , we would most likely agree in the process .
In other words , it is active .
While the second sentence tells the same story , it 's weak and weak .
Is Using the voice `` Using Passive '' ?
You probably learned in school that you are supposed to avoid passive voice at all costs .
It is n't technically wrong .
In fact , there are times when it makes sense to opt for passive voice over active voice .
For example , you legitimately to bring attention to the receiver of the action , instead of the action performing the pool .
The person performing the action is unknown or a cheeseburger was accidentally accidentally accidentally dropped into the pool .
When you want to intentionally identifying the performer of the action then you will be collected on Monday .
I regularly used in scientific writing to take the researcher .

Tips for cheaters and Passive when it comes to choosing between active and passive voice .

Consider the writers you takes a couple of stabs at a blog post or article before it is complete .
At the moment , stage , remember , sometimes subject , target — , and target — where possible .
Add Zombies .
Zombies ?
Yes , and here is why .
If you are not sure if a sentence is in active or passive voice , try adding `` zombies '' by zombies .
If it makes sense , you are probably passive .
The pool water was very enjoyable .
is a passive sentence .
If you have been following along along , you know that it is also inaccurate .
The pool in question was very certain that a cheeseburger .

In particular , use images to your advantage .

Also , let us not forget that some people are visual .
You can often serve their interests by presenting their interests by adding graphic information .
Leave plenty of white space .

There is a quick grammar quiz for you .
The two sentences are correct .
Both Julia took Edward and I to the movies .
Julia took Edward and I to the movies .
While you may hear either of those sentences in conversation , it is only one of them is right .
Do you know which ?
It is the second sentence .
I am not sure why .
Let 's take a closer look at these two , sometimes confusing .
It is all About Me ( or I ) .
Personal pronouns like I me , he , their , and them do not give writers much trouble . I had a cup of coffee before leaving for work .
I am the subject of the sentence .
They left me a note before leaving on vacation .
I am the object of the verb left .
Where things start to get tricky , however , is when you have a sentence with two objects or two objects joined by the word `` and '' .
For example : The stray followed Alex , and I am all the way down the street .
I / Anna & Me decided to go for a walk .
The good news is that there is a trick for figuring out which pronoun to use .
All you have to do is remove the other person from the sentence .
When you do , it becomes obvious to the cat followed by the street followed by the street .
I decided to go for a walk .
The same then holds true when you add the other person back in the street .
I decided to go for a walk .
When in doubt , it is the sentence in question and you will find it much easier .

I get a great feeling of satisfaction when all of my laundry is done .
The clothes are washed , pressed , and possibly put away .
Of course , things are put away in my mind .
Sometimes it is that feeling of being done with a task – if I include clothes from all of my family members .
It is really nice to look at the empty , hampers and think , all done !
And that feeling it is hard for a few hours later when we all have dirty clothes to wash once again .
It is the gift that keeps giving .
Just when you think you are done , there is more .
I believe it is the same way .
Imagine the feeling of accomplishment , when you have added all of your important terminology .
Every word properly spelled , usage rules , preferred defined , preferred defined , and so on .
It is an occurrence for some of my brain .
I work with customers who have ten thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand ninety .
I believe each one is neither quick or simple .

We rejoice when we finish a terminology project .
I wonder if popped .
We cue the Snoopy music .
We dancing around the things room .
Maybe not the next day or two there are new terms .
You have a new company .
Perhaps you have a new product to Launch .
I think that would be a new brand .
Or , like so many companies these days , your marketing department has made up six or seven new words that are not in the dictionary .
When you think your terminology is finished , you have more .
My point is that never .
It is never complete and never finished .
If you fail to acknowledge and act on this little , you will find your database or word list .
Once it is out of date , you will no longer need to use it .
They will be very frustrated because the new terms are constantly as spelling .
Your legal department and product will be angry because writers are not using the new words .
You maintain your terminology .
You should revisit it , preferably a schedule .
It depends on your company ; you might need to review terms only once every six months .
It is a difficult review if things change quickly .
Make sure you look for New terms that need to be added Of course , having a process in place for keeping your terminology fresh is helpful .
It is as if you separate your whites and colors , you want to make sure you organize your terms before you toss them into the mix .
It is good to define a process , so that content creators can suggest new terms and existing existing terms .
If you define the process in advance , updating your database or word list will be easier for everyone .
If you have no process , your content creators will send you random words , and you will have to figure out what to do with them until you are ready .
You will never get the changes because folks will not know what to do with their suggestions .
Even with the best intentions , your team will inevitably to the updates because they are so busy .
Do not let your terminology sit in a damp , dark corner getting older .
Instead , give it a scheduled , give it a scheduled .
Your content will be fresh as a difficult one .

This is a modern lot of modern content in 2017
While 17th century `` content '' '' — is old , believe letters , journals , books , and manuals but manuals is content .
It was a lot harder to produce and disseminate .
Let 's take a look at some of the reasons why you are creating content in modern age .
We are able to distribute and distribute content quickly .
But , Johannes Gutenberg the printing in 1440 . The Pilgrims would n't have one of their own until the 1700s . ''
Everything was written by hand and put copied if necessary .
Just creation was a long and laborious process .
The majority of us never write anything by hand anymore , unless it is a Post-it .
Instead , we are accustomed to creating content at the touch of a button , wherever we are .
In the meantime , the Pilgrim is letters would take months to travel and forth to England .
In today 's instantaneously , even just waiting a few seconds for something to upload seems like an eternity .
You can not enable it to enable Wi-Fi to feel like a disaster .
We have a lot of content formats and channels .
I believe it is distributed through messages , a limited number of letters , and a church sermons .
And while that worked , just compare it to the wealth of communication channels .
We consume content on our laptops , but phones .
We listen to podcasts , watch webinars , and videos , read , and videos , and we have social media .
That is the tip .
We have facts and figures rather than gossip .
Most people are familiar with the concept of Chinese Whispers and how facts and messages can easily be distorted .
Back in the Pilgrim 's time , it was incredibly hard to verify information and identify `` potential news '' .
It can be published at the time presented at the time presented in the local happenings .
You only have to search the issue Witch Trials to see the horrific impact of gossip .
We can have a wealth of tools to help us separate the fake , to back up our assertions , and provide us with accurate statistics .
It can show us what 's trending , but can show us what is trending making the rounds of reliable sources .
In addition , we can use tools to use tools to analyze and measure of the results .
I can make the right content by checking it in front of their time by checking it in front of the audience and putting it in front of the audience .
We benefit from greater diversity .
The religious teachings were a deeply Puritanical that ironically , given , given they left England in search of religious teachings .
In short , you had to watch what you said .
Currently , we have it more freedom and creativity and what we communicate .
We have diverse voices and points , which lead to better , richer voices .
These are different types of books from the bible , the bible , the bible , Pilgrims .
They were content starved as well .
The contrast in which contrast is the biggest challenges . It is figuring out how to make their content stand in a world where content is literally .
Your modern content can be found in the 17th century .
Modern content has a unique challenges .
It has become an entire industry because it is more important than it is , diverse and interesting .
It is certainly food for modern content , but it is certainly high on your list .
If you are a certain looking woman to use it , you will find a lot of excitement about it , but how to actually apply it to your business .
However , that is definitely changing . Thank you for the good work from Paul Roetzer and the folks at the Marketing AI .
Over the past few years . They 've tested various AI , solutions , implemented , and talked to solutions .
The third use of AI can make a big impact for marketers , where AI can make it better .
I believe AI is the Acrolinx of a brand AI `` reads all of a brand 's content , then recommends ways to improve it — . ''
It is a problem that is content that is on-brand , and can on-target by using AI to provide guidance and governance .
To learn more about it , our AI is platform platform AI , platform platform out our webinar , Acrolinx .
I believe it is a dream .
As both a messaging , it can be a highly engaged community community and a social network worldwide worldwide .
I demographics by younger generations , but new social platforms are today .
That is a result of growing popularity ; it is now an average of ten billion video .
Even though it was quick to take note of this powerful , what about brands ?
If you are a certain , can you be considering it ?
Is it a waste of time and money trying to market on a platform extent and men Z-ers ?
It depends on the answer .
Should Brands Brands B2B ?
There are a number of good reasons why a B2B might consider branching .
I like a lot of social media , but it plays on people 's fear of missing out or FOMO .
No one does it better because Snapchat does it better than just 24 hours .
In other words , catch it now or you will miss your chance .
What is the point ?
Well , it is a matter of playing to human psychology .
I would add curiosity , as it is possible and our need for positive reinforcement , which can be sated , and you 've got the perfect recipe for keeping people back .
There is not surprisingly many , many large people can not be trusted .
The bands Among others , these include General Electric , IBM , is the same company , and NASA .
It is a simple : because Snapchat allows you to create content on your mobile phone in real time , down-to-earth is a way for brands , down-to-earth is a way for brands .
In fact , it can help even the most unexpected brands appear , and fun .
It is possible that it is possible to allow your company to shine in unexpected .
I believe it is immediacy , but high engagement and the views it delivers .
I am unsure of how to begin .
Let 's explore the various types of content that B2B on companies .
I platform a story or channel you can distribute the key information or distribute it through the key information , shareable .
I believe for all it is immediacy , is no different .
I believe it is the strategy in which moments in which moments , I believe it is moments .
It can be as easy as creating a working list of questions before an event , or clearly with your rules .
Make use of your thought Leaders on your corporate building .
I would suggest that you go behind the scenes and showcase them at the same time , conferences .
People love getting a glimpse behind the curtain , and Snapchat .
It is your social media team , but also Sneak Peeks .
By all means , allow them a little freedom with a series of customer Q and videos from videos .
Set them free on the room floor to record and sneak short guest interviews or sneak peeks of your brand .
It is the new , it is important to say that the two individuals are in the same situation .
I am hoping for the event to finish .
If there are guest speakers from trade shows , you can do the same thing .
It user-generated to create your industry , encourage clients .
If it is either suits you business , dedicate one day a week to answer direct .
If things get awkward or a question requires an in-depth , politely ask to take the conversation .
If you are worried that a question and a might go off the rails , be sure to have your social media standing by to manage the situation .
I believe you are n't comfortable with an application , but Worth Considering because you are n't comfortable with an application like Snapchat .
That is ok .
It is an option that you should consider .
It may not be compatible with your brand , or you simply may not have the time or resources for another social content .
If you do have the resources and money to dip your toe in Snapchat , it is worth giving it a try .
Do n't get built in a vacuum relationships , and relationships do n't get built in a vacuum .
They get built across all kinds of different , touchpoints and channels .
What 's the kids ' on Snapchat today ?
They might just be the next generation of buyers and deal makers .

The Guide to Developing to Developing .
Even the best writers make mistakes , when it comes to using that , that is in a sentence .
They are both relative , but used to introduce it and help avoid help , overly , they are not interchangeable .
Unless you are writing in British English .
What is the story with `` that ? '' and `` when and how do you use them correctly ? ''
It can be difficult to modify , but it can modify words .
It is unlike it , but it typically modify , rather than a single word .
Whether you use it or not , it depends on the nature of the clause you are modifying .
Use the word `` `` `` restrictive '' clauses .
I believe it is necessary to help you understand the overall meaning of a sentence .
I can modify at that .
For example : Books that are super-suspenseful are a lot of fun to read .
In our example , that is super-suspenseful .
It is unclear what type of books you are referring to ; it is unclear what types of books you are referring to .
Can you please use which type it is ?
I believe clauses is ones that are n't essential for you to understand the overall meaning of the sentence .
You can remove them without very much meaning .
We modify them . That 's which .
As the Books , which you can increasingly online , are a great tool for learning .
Even though the writer is saying that books you can increasingly find online , the fact is that the writer is great .
This is a strange information that allows us to grasp the sentence .
It is difficult to Trick if grammar terms , such as , `` restrictive and relative , make your eyes even over , you are not alone . ''
Here is a good , alternative way to help you use it .
If you would naturally put a comma before and after the clause , it is a nonrestrictive , and you need to use which .
If it is however you would not put it around it , then it is a restrictive occurrence .
There are exceptions , exceptions to the Rule .
If that is the case , many writers will interchange `` that '' .
The classic `` That does n't kill you makes you stronger . ''
Technically , it is incorrect .
But , I think you will agree , that that does not kill you makes you stronger .

Bopped , jargon , jargon , buzzwords .
You will hear these terms often .
There are similarities between them and each has a slightly different meaning .
It means that speaking before we can hone in on an effective approach to ( not using buzzwords . )
Here is a list of my favorites .
I believe age and age age and class tends to understand quickly .
Think of words like groovy , hip , rock , hot , and on fire . All of which have come into fashion .
Is dictated that used in a particular industry or art form , and is dictated by one 's personal choices ?
It is often used to convey those in hidden meanings and only those in the related arenas .
In the business world , in the business world , due to the fact , sweat equity .
In the meantime , buzzwords by definition are usually technical words , or phrases chiefly .
These include terms of expressions like forward-thinking , synergy .
You may have noticed that it is very close to being the same thing .
The difference is that there is their intention .
I can show-off members club in their worst , but can come across one 's status .
With that said , it is not necessarily all bad .
They serve as an equal level of communication , and then create a feeling of connection with a team environment .
If you are up on the lingo , you are part of the in-crowd .
To Buzzword or Not Buzzword or Buzzword , how can you use them and when it is best to avoid them ?
There are a few things to ask yourself when you are unsure whether there is a simpler way to communicate the idea you are trying to convey .
Would the problem add , or serve to only illustrate ?
Do you think your readers can understand this ?
( They might ! )
I can offer many hard buzzwords and phrases have moved from the public lexicon .
Am I only using the word to show-off ?
Am I attempting to speak above my audience ?
If this buzzword is n't used , does that imply that I do n't know what I 'm talking about ?
Am I 100 percent confident that I know exactly what this can mean ?
Using a definite way to know is a definite no-no .
It will make your content — , and by extension , your company — .
Last , but not least . Make sure you know whether your audience or industry likes buzzwords .
Some groups are strong in their topic , so make sure to adapt your usage .
It can be hard to end the relationship below .
Try to avoid them if you can .
Even though I have become a bit tired , I think you should take something that is outside of the needle and overused on the box Leverage outside the box .
Be certain to have a look at what can do to help you move the needle with your corporate content .
See what we just did there ?
Is it bad ?
It is simply another occurrence to avoid it !
For more information on how to gather , manage , and enforce , even and even buzzwords .
There is no doubt about it .
When it comes to B2B , a sound content is critical is critical .
In fact , almost 90 percent of it B2B to drive profitability last year .
I am not only aware of the content of their content , but three quarters of them increased their content budget , staffing .
What these statistics suggest is that there is an insatiable appetite for content .
There are companies under the mind of it .
In a blog posts , and white papers to podcasts , webinars , and more , companies more to create an endless list of content materials .
Any content professional will tell you how it can be to produce one piece of content , days or even months .
As being said , unless you have unlimited resources , you need to find ways to work smarter and more .
In this post , we will look at some creative approaches to maximizing your work and your content marketing .
I believe you do n't need to start from scratch for every piece of content .
I believe and repurposing are the easiest ways to get the maximum return on your content investment .
There are two ways to do this .
You should create a piece of content before you create a piece of content .
A white paper , a white paper into something else , a blog series , a blog or a video .
When you work from this , I understand you will find your approach to content creation .
Look back at your existing content to give it new life .
Perhaps it just needs a refresh or a new angle .
Or it could be that the information is still current and you can repurpose it into a different format to make it feel fresh .
The idea is to work more difficult , not harder than many people as possible .
Using the right technology there is a lot of software and tech out there that can help scale your content .
at the Google Analytics , and BuzzSumo , for example , can help you identify the best keywords for a topic , and then show you top-performing .
You need to start with your content , you need to start with well-written material .
It is better writing better results .
You could have content on a trending topic , the presented with a fresh new angle .
If it is poorly written , you will turn off your audience .
The quality content is important , and if you do not have an inbox , think about investing in an important active AI-driven .
I can help this help you content the content of your business , in an odd way .
So you can actually predict and improve the impact of your business — .
I can also automate on social profiles , and send out content at the optimum time to reach your specific audiences .
You want to deliver your content through the right channels , at the right time , to the right people .
Lastly , you can use analytics to see how your content performs , and direct resources .
There is no point in creating and publishing . If no one is consuming them .
It is possible to have more efficient , but it is possible to have efficient , and it can still save you a lot of time .
I believe templates will and can workflows for each content format and less time figuring out how to do it .
Brand it and a style guide can be tools to understand what your message is .
If you want to remove confusion , speed up the process , and keep your content on .
In another good idea , if you do regular content , audits on reports and reports , so you can identify any missed opportunities .
I can create enough pressure to create fresh and interesting content day after day .
That is why it makes sense to get the most out of each piece of work every time .
When you create great content , you would like to get it in front of as many people as possible .
If you are turning an article into a white paper , a blog post into an article , or a research report into a video , or report results in a video .
That is a plan that should be music to every content team .
How AI can dramatically your content performance and come away with an action ?
When it comes to creating content — more , and more marketing marketing is always changing .
As technology as well , advances and content are expectations .
I can not give it a list of instruments such as `` kicking off '' , I have a list of predators trends .
How content will be created on how content will be created .
They should therefore be the top of everyone who uses content to communicate with their target audience .
The rise of voice search will interact with voice-activated .
As a voice searches increase , through devices such as Amazon , and Google , you can change .
Voice is a good voice , voice rings are always good .
As a result , content marketers from their content , so voice search engines .
Voice is longer than traditional voice , voice , and more keywords .
What is the cost to ask explicit questions ?
Check out that means there is going to be a new focus on creating content on creating content around creating content .
As a content professional , you will need to understand how search engines provide answers and searchable .
I augmented consumers in virtual reality , then Captain reality , then Captain reality is predicted to explode .
I am not sure why to take advantage of these new tactics and take advantage of these new tactics .
The easiest way to start is to remake existing existing for 3D viewing and interaction .
However , marketers is incredibly valuable for creating connections and markets .
It is Facebook and Facebook and Apple has all made it in Arizona .
Just as 3D penalizes on websites for not being mobile responsive , it 's rankings in the future for 3D viewing 3D .
Using Intelligence is a better task to understand and create better content in today 's market a huge task .
AI is improving production by making it more , predictive , and productive .
I believe user user data data can be used to identify in their stages of the marketing data , therefore it can be taken to identify consumer .
I believe marketers will increasingly use AI , and whose potential performance is understood .
I want to keep up with the pressure of creating it , useful content on a daily basis , and useful content on the content they produce higher .
When it comes to using video to communicate about your brand , live streaming about your brand and business .
People are four times more likely to watch a video about it than to read about it .
The average video post , but post 135 percent greater than photos .
By 2019 , video content will account for 80 percent of all global internet consumption .
Video is an powerful way to engage in a relationship with customers , and they want more .
In fact , 43 percent of people want to see more video content from marketers .
At 2018 , it is not just video production that will increase , but will become core to online content .
I can currently have shown that viewers spend longer than on-demand .
I can how-tos their efforts on creating explainers and concentrate on opportunities .
I know it 's hard to know of live streaming streaming gives it customers .
It also creates engagement social content .
You can chat technology , and do n't have a conversation technology .
This is probably says that 80 percent of businesses will use chatbots .
I believe that use chatbots customer , chatbots and higher service .
People like them because they offer an efficient , yet personalized service .
In addition , they do not need to leave the environment of their are apps or download a new one .
It is not too expensive for non-tech , companies to invest in , and they can integrate with a range of messaging services .
When you consider that nearly two billion people use it , Facebook , and WeChat .
If you want to use technology for better results , then investing in chatbots .
As a content professional , it will be up to you to figure these new channels to communicate with your audience .
The secret to the secret is to stay ahead of the secret .
As far as become more sophisticated and technology more advanced , content marketers , and adapt to survive .
With 2018 , make sure you are thinking of these fields and how you can take advantage of them .
What is the impact of content on brand brand trust ?
Can you measure it ?
Does better content lead to more sales ?

Everyone knows how important content is for your business .
It is a critical tool for attracted to more new people and communicating with the people you have already .
But no one seems to talk about the fact that creating great content is difficult .
How can they overcome more about the challenges that companies face in creating content ?
At the end of last year we surveyed more than 250 content practices .
We were mostly working at either working at either small businesses or big businesses , and Mastercard .
It is a difficult situation to learn what we learned , but Professionals Seen to Be Seen as Authoritative .
Artists among them are a desire to produce content that demonstrates their company forward and authority to help their business .
The Key to Those things is High-Quality , but Informative to meet these goals .
Show and offer some advice on it .
Write with an engaging style and tone of voice .
In my opinion , you can get in their way Despite their best intentions Despite the content of challenges .
The include factors ranging from not having enough time .
I can Challenges , these challenges , hurdles is to overcome .
As 39 percent of companies said that they have enough content in-house to meet their content needs .
In my opinion , the rest of the work is not important to writers .
In the companies most companies , 63 is a siloed creation .
This can lead to issues with quality and other things .
Speaking of consistency said that their company has a corporate style guide , only 30 percent of them said it is followed by 30 percent of them .
In the meantime , 52 percent of the respondents said their voice is average or weak .
What all of this is that content creators do not have it easy .
There are still plenty of ways to be effective .
Currently , Today 's content is creating better professionals , but now on more people for help , using a variety of artificial intelligence to intelligence .
They are getting results .
I can get the full story and better understand how Top Business Approach your copy of different companies .
The global economy is great opportunities for organizations that want to expand their customer .
If you are targeting non-English countries , getting your message across , and staying , on-brand in another language , can be difficult .
The quality of your source is so important .
If you are localizing on multiple countries , begin with the best source content is critical .
If your source is n't up to scratch , the subsequent translations will be poor .
You will end up paying more for translations so that it will understand what you are trying to communicate .
Some certain things are ready to make certain that your content is ready .
Keep sentences brief and simple .
It is important to remember the subject for writing in plain English when you are creating content for translation .
You want to increase comprehension and boost it by keeping it simple for both the translator .
So , keep your sentences short — or less .
You are your wording and try to keep in mind .
You will find that there are many extra words that you do not need .
Reading sentences aloud will help you pare .
Always use the active , rather than the passive voice , so there is less chance for confusion .
For example , you should replace the file should be opened and the relevant document is opened the file document .
Using active voice also affects the number of words that you translators .
I believe it 's clear , and clear sentences well-constructed from the quality of your source .
You should choose a uniform word .
It is tempting to vary terms of terms you use often to improve the flow .
It 's one uniform word for nouns and stick to it .
It can increase the time and cost the time and cost the message .
Here is where a style guide is helpful , especially if your company uses a lot of terms to mean the same thing .
Once you have established , once you have established language , you can translation faster because there is more information in the translator 's memory bank .
Avoid any humor and be unsuccessful .
Take it out for extremely difficult time , and it rarely translates at something or appropriately .
The joke could either fall flat , end up as nonsense as nonsense .
The best way to navigate this occurrence is to eliminate it altogether .
The same goes for metaphors , idioms and colloquialisms .
For example , we might say someone luck in English .
In Italian , they say that in bocca , all lupo into the wolf 's mouth .
These are entirely different phrases that express the concept .
If you are relying about another translation , you should pass the town red if you are relying in another translation .
If a phrase does n't make sense , then do n't use it .
If a lot of expression might help , reduce the word by conveying .
However , if it does not make sense to the target audience , you have wasted all of your words .
It can help .
That is a great technology source for translation .
It 's a content , but platform example , for example , can identify and help , and help you , and simplify .
This is especially the case if you are doing a lot of it .
In the meantime , your content can also store words in a terminology to make sure you are using them consistently .
You can also use it to use authoring memory to reuse sentences , which can save an issue .
Keep it simple .
You need to achieve success in success with people in their own language .
This requires good content that is clean , clear , and easy to understand .
Getting the right quality will save you time , money , and face from the start .
I am using the right words , but ensures you are using the right words and phrases consistently .

They need to become more focused and efficient , by taking advantage of the best tools and techniques .
A quarter of content professionals said that they were adopting technology challenges .
Almost half of them are using content creation and optimization , followed by organizational .

People will not hesitate to point out .
What is the Difference between them and their .
There are the difficult and fast rules for using their . There 's as well as the differences between them .
We are going over there .

It 's hard to connect with their social media shorthand shorthand to their brand more personality , but give them their brand more personality .
Here is how to get it right .
You know your way is how we communicate is constantly .
Do n't emojis .
They have grown up with social shortcuts and are used to peppering .
If you are a B2B focused on a range of demographics , it may not always be appropriate to include winking or two-second .

The last thing you want is to confuse your target audience .
You have brand voice needs to be certain to build trust and loyalty .
Do not be fooled into treating social media as flippant .
I am unsure if their use of all of your content and communications is what they use .
Do they add value to what you are trying to communicate ?
Do they look like something that your company would get behind ?
If it is a serious topic , you should leave them out .
You can use emojis and other images as a visual shortcut to your brand .

Everybody Writes , as content guru out in the title of her , 2014 .
And while that simple statement could not be more true , it is something we often take for granted .
We tend to associate writing professional writers .
I believe , authors , in general , are the type of writers — , they are the ones creating all of the content .
Well , not exactly .
Many other people create content for public consumption , too .
That is where things start to get tricky , especially if they are not able to communicate their ideas clearly .
It is probably the first age .
I believe it is a prime example .
If you think they only write code , you are mistaken .
The reality is that they typically have to write comments or annotations that get embedded in their code .
Those comments are important .
They provide the necessary documentation and instruction for others .
To be able to interpret the code , to be able to interpret it .
In fact , the comments explaining the code typically run much longer than the code itself .
If those comments are not clear , I believe they can confuse everyone who has to confuse everyone else who has to read them .
That may not be an issue if you sit next to the person who wrote the comments and ask questions .
That is rarely the case .
These days , so many products are available to other companies with their own preferences .
For that to be a smooth , seamless process , the comments need to interpret and interpret .
That is not always the case .
I believe that writers are n't necessarily good writers .
In fact , many of them are not native English speakers .
This begs the question . Do you have to hire developers who know how to create great code ?
Do you hire great things , and then go to the trouble of training them on how to become better writers ?
Do you have your own writers and `` editors '' and correct all of the comments and time-consuming ?
None of these options is ideal .
You can embed into Acrolinx , Acrolinx .

Forget about clunky messaging and repetitive phrases .
Even though in AI , today is chatbots today 's chatbots and able to engage in more human-like .
It is this conversational tone and the rush , but it is hard to customers .

About these and other benefits , it is not surprising to start using chatbots .
However , creating a great chatbot chatbot requires the talents of a strong content .
That person needs to be able to craft messaging and dialogue that is useful .
Here is a fast guide to writing for a completely certain situation .
It may happen , but it is a funny thing to do it , and you should just talk about it .
Similar to how you are feeling has a carefully crafted persona , brand persona , and brand voice .
In addition , that personality needs to come through it .
Your company is as an ambassador for your brand and create dialogue , and best reflect your company 's values .
They can be funny , cheerful , friendly , and friendly .
Even though there are grown up with bots , have grown up with bots and are very used to talk to bots .
Once you have determined your chatbot , the words are flow much more easily in the bot 's voice .

It is UI to be helpful , and fulfill a specific goal .
Do not let jokes happen to your customer rather than a tool .
If you keep it money , you can try a few blocks blocks to make a copy of long blocks .
If you are messages , you will lose their interest and lose their attention .
It is supposed to be a conversation , so let 's use users to speak and ask questions .
A conversation , you should use short sentences and break up your answers into different messages .
When you do need more information ( such as when explaining a process or a solution ) , keep it step-driven and succinct .
There are no visual cues , every word you uses matters .
You need to be confident in what a user would reasonably reasonably reasonably .
Ask yourself and you can determine whether messages make sense before them .
Also avoid being overly complicated and phrasing . And , of course , make sure there are no spelling or grammatical .
Similar to content on the internet and marketing material , I can not despise seeing it at all .
If you are worried with errors you can go elsewhere .
Do not think that you can just copy and paste existing content from your website or recycle it into chatbot .
I believe will see through this immediately .
Instead , start by using the person 's name and any personal information .
Your bot is a character with a personality .
Do n't use dialogue that sounds like it is out of a manual or the response of a faceless .
You are representing your company , but not communicating as the company .
Remember that it is a conversation , the user is talking to your bot , not reading your website .
Try to create a personal connection to the person engaging in sexual relations .
Do the content of the AI `` The AI behind '' it will continue to evolve and advance .
It is not a case of set it and forget it .
You need to keep in mind that you are creating the best customer experience , and you can also revisiting the best customer experience .

Think of your bot as a living personality that has more to say and bring it to life with your content .

The challenge is to create valuable content , but that 's also consistent in style and tone of voice .
In order to start a relationship , the company implemented across a number of it 's business .
In the meantime for Marketing Content , Platforms , James Mathewson to doing so .
This is how he breaks it down .
Managing one of the biggest challenges , it is faced or having multiple content teams .
This was the same as a waste of valuable resources .
I suggest that you get around it , but it is not something that works for me .
When his writers create content , it gets tagged , topic , product , and life cycle .
This allows each problems to be placed exactly where it needs to be , and also ensures it can be quickly .

Do Mathewson and guidance on writers , when content writers understand how the software can maintain quality ?
It can also happen , but it does n't matter if it 's just tangible .
I believe favors an content approach and an content works , and what does not testing .
He is the only way to prove your efforts to business results .
By looking at the company 's KPIs of visitors , leads , marketing marketing leads , and customers Acrolinx to quality quality .
By the way of individual teams teams , he is able to see which areas need more help and which ones are doing really well .
He is also able to drill down and see the performance of content against each other against each other , brand family , and product .
This helps him understand what is working well , not just from a quality perspective but from a performance perspective .
Have the results to valuable valuable , such as how more personalized content doubles and drives sales .
It 's content to identify opportunities in this way to identify opportunities and optimize .
However , I can not demonstrate the value of the company of the company of the company of the company of success and the simple strategy in which it has given the company of success and seemingly to demonstrate the truth .

If you asked to create huge amounts of content , you can easily run out of ideas .
However , with the suggestions above , you should be able to keep your content content running for a long time .
Good luck !
I believe it is one of the keys to good content .
It is what helps your audience to feel like your company is always speaking to them with one clear voice .
One way of trying is to maintain an corporate guide .
It may sound easy if creating one and encouraging all of your content to adhere to the case .
That is because in practice , corporate style is difficult to enforce .
Let 's look at what is and why that is a possible solution to the problem may be .
Why are types of things in common ?
They establish your company 's brand voice and brand .
They help it , but it is consistency by serving as the things things are done .
It is a good style , but dictate an preferences on everything .
How to spell certain words to the right way to use grammar , and industry- and company-specific .
Getting all of this stuff is important , because when an important content is important , it looks true .
Not only that , it can muddy the message . The company is trying to get across , and can even confuse what .
It is difficult for a moment and it 's style guide to your organization , communicate your spelling , and avoid errors .
That is particularly true for certain things with many content creators spread across different offices .
In the absence of face-to-face , it can be your company 's particular style , having a style guide can be found an effective way to keep everyone 's opinions .
Why are they difficult to Enforce ?
Even at least among content typically get created and distributed to lots of fanfare .
The problem is that most people quickly lose their enthusiasm and eventually stop .
They usually think they either know the information or not .
In the meantime , hard copies get lost and PDFs .
If the style of the style is too long , it becomes possible .
If it is too short , it wo n't contain enough guidance to most content creators .
Another challenge that makes it difficult is the fact that a style guide should always be a living document .
I believe new words come into play , and new products come into play , and new products are introduced .
Most traditional style guides are static in nature , and if you do edit them , you will have to alert them .
In other words , style can be maintained and content creators .
It can be a significant occurrence at a large level .
Smart Style Guides , but style can be for creating consistent consistent and use .
That is where it comes in .
Our company 's unique style can be found at the same level of company .
I would assume that you to make whatever changes they are necessary to bring your content in line with those standards .
It does all of this in whatever content you happen to be using .
This kind of can not make a serious style and tone of voice , and across all of your company 's content .
It 's true for large , but large organizations of people creating content who may not be professional writers .
I can not believe with your company 's individual preferences . You can ensure that everyone writes in the exact same way .
In the meantime , you are in the process of being in the midst of traditional style , but rather traditional style may not be the easiest to use and enforce .
It is possible to make the task a lot easier to make the task a lot easier by offering a lot easier way to enforce .
A creator does not have to constantly check if they 're writing , correct ?
Any method that makes the effort less painful and more effective has to be a little creators and the companies that I use .

If electricity is working , CEO is one of the `` AI '' most important things electricity .
That quote has reverberated every industry and and content marketing marketing is no exception .
Where is AI going ?
What does the future live ?
Perhaps most importantly for our purposes , how do you actually start ?
Marketing AI Institute founder Roetzer . may have the answers .
It 's a Bloomberg , Down AI Down Roetzer to recall 10 years ago .
We did not have it , Snapchat , Alexa , or Slack .
Even the iPhone had only been born , no one — . Steve Jobs could have fully predicted the impact that it would have .
It is very similar to AI .
Basically , Roetzer , Roetzer that AI augments , at scales .
AI is already ubiquitous and something that we use dozens of dozens .
From Facebook 's life recognition , software to tag people in photos , to Google , and Siri .
Not only that , with each passing day , AI gets more convenient and more personalized .
In AI , deep learning is trying to teach machines to think like the human mind .
In content marketing applications applications are about using Natural Language and Law though .
How is AI changing what we do ?
The five Ps for Getting Started with AI is better content .
I Associated Press reports that it has gone from publishing reports 300 earnings to the help of AI .
In the movie `` 2016 '' , The Washington Post published high school sports stories , Voldemort , and election , coverage coverage that once again written machines .
It is clear , but the future is already here .
If you have any kind of data-driven , you need to get on board right now .
If you are wondering how , here are five Ps to get started with AI .
You need to analyze your existing position .
There are tons of specific options options that can give you useful information .
You can capture information on your spelling ad , monitor the digital ad space , and determine how much others bought .
You can map content content to the buyer journey to the buyer journey , identify keywords , and predict what you are content .
There are software companies that can be used to use ones that can not use an email out-perform .
It may have helped you to learn from , but imagine a human trying to do that .
To be able to create content at scale — across scale across scale across scale across scale — , and to do it in the correct tone , marketer .
Using AI , content can not only automate some data-driven on what they write about .
However , far from machines replacing human replacing human beings , Roetzer is using AI to enrich .
It seems that some days a lot of marketing money is going into bots .
That is especially true of bots that initiate conversations with consumers at the right time .
While we might rely on some study to tell us that the time to send our emails is a Thursday , AI can do a much deeper dive .
It can tell you exactly when a specific kind of customer will open it .
No matter whether you have it or 100,000 subscribers will take a scattergun .
They will set a rule that says an email at a specific time and hope for the best .
The other hand can segment those customers .
I will make sure that the message arrives in 10.45 if you make sure that the message arrives in 10.45 .
Do the play button be green or blue to get consumers to follow ?
Some people will be more biased in one color .
This is the kind of substance that humans can not figure out in any way .
Nor should they be trying to .
Especially when machines can do this more quickly , accurately , and efficiently on our behalf .
Using data data , AI can write social media updates , figure out what image to include , and publish for maximum results .
Even intelligent software using AI will recommend colors , colors hashtags , adjust the send date , and alter the channel .
People in scale will never be able to do this , especially at scale .
If we do n't want to create perfect content , we want to predict what will be most successful content .
Just as companies as Amazon and Google make it work , it can appeal to most things that we know about them .
I believe the data data is time spent time spent machines rather than writers who put the essential message .
I am leaders to get on board with today 's writers and move on .
Look at things that are manual and repetitive and require data .
Once identified , content managers should consider the AI capabilities within their existing marketing preferences .
The bottom line , he says , `` Is that when you discover ways to use software more intelligently , you have more time to create intelligent content .
Do you want to hear more from Paul Roetzer ?
It is possible to see his video below from our recent Content .
Focus on Top Businesses from the world to better understand their content creation practices .
If you download the report below to get recommendations , what every content should be doing in their content .
It may not be at all content creator , but some content is simple for successful , effective communication .
It can have dozens , or hundreds , or even thousands of unique terms of unique terms .
That gives the names for their products and services .
The problem is that when teams is different , use different terms to describe and higher costs .
It is all of the communication in your communication .
Based on contrast , it is difficult to bring of terminology can bring an array of business benefits .
You should take a closer look at four of the benefits .
It can also examine some of the things that can happen when you do not .
I understand even though it is a better situation , even if companies fail to use terms in their content , it can be confusing and alike .
For example , imagine a customer who buys a computer , based on the description of features and components on the description .
When she receives the computer , the manual that comes with different terms to describe the same things .
I finally calls she calls customer service . Where tries to help using another set of words ?
Even the customer experience in the business , you can trust your business and can drive potential to competitors .
People want simplicity , clarity and information they can understand .
There is no need to confound customers , or your own , it when it is easy to create consistent content , simplified content .
It is better to worry about your content into other languages .
I believe it is a particular term , but you select a particular term once , it is possible .
I believe the use of particular terms saves on saves .
It is especially true if you are translating again and again , or you are translating into lots of different languages .
Apply different terms for the same thing . It will make the translation process harder , and can lead to confusion , and messaging .
Using the right terminology ; on the other hand , will help you your content is and that the terms are accurately translated .
I 'm driving Down and it makes it clear to everyone who is creating content which terms they should not use .
When content is consistent , there is less editing and revising .
Furthermore , when the source terms are consistent , translation , their approved is faster and more efficient , driving down the cost of what can otherwise be an expensive exercise .
Brand Voice A clear and a clear voice is important for any business .
Be defined to help employees can help , and recognize brand voice .
The price may be needed to adjust their messaging when they are available into different markets .
With a defined set of terms that is used to set a board set of terms that is used across the board , companies can promote a unified brand loyalty and attention .
I create the right Words Words create terms that should be used across an extent .
If you want to create it easily , effective content that can be easily easily , and then drives down costs .
I believe content creators across industries simply , more quickly , and more .
Just content content with global audiences becomes easier and produces better results .
It is quite simply terminology , but better content means better content .

It 's hard to bring and character to writing .
They bring your content to life and can create interest and familiarity .
All of these benefits can be if you use them incorrectly .
It happens more than that happens more than we realize .
Most of us have used a particular expression before , at a great length , only to find out that our interpretation of it was wrong .
In fact , this is so common that there is a term for the mechanism for the mechanism that creates many of them .
It may happen when a phrase is misheard because it sounds like something else , and then gets misused .
There are many other reasons why people tend to understand wrong .
Do you not want to make the same mistake you have ?
You can be sure to always use this list if you use common interests to be sure to always use them .
I can not care less .
If you could care less , then you have not reached your strongest point yet , and you are not making your strongest point .
The phrase is actually used with it , it is frequency in jest .
I can not care less because a correction can not provide a Correct .
It is another thing coming .
This is an example of a misheard expression that makes sense on it .
However , when you are familiar with the entire phrase , you understand that it misses you .
I 'm not certain a certain gift is coming to another suggestions .
I 'm not sure , Peak my interest .
Are you able to locate a peak ?
Perhaps , but there is an actual word for that .
I 'm not a fan of a scam .
It is not possible for further than you can .
If you know the difference between the words , , it is and ado , then you are ahead of the curve .
If you do not , then you have likely likely this occurrence .
I can not give a correction to a certain degree of a scam .
I 'm not sure : Chomping at the bit .
While the misheard version makes sense , the original version makes sense .
Instead of `` chomping '' , it is a more formal occurrence .
By the way , a bit is used with a reign to control a horse .
I 'm not a celebrity .
It is probably the case , Hunger pains .
It is almost three to understand and you still have not had anything to eat .
There is a rattle .
You should not say that you have `` hunger pains '' because the original phrase is meant to describe the itself itself .
I believe a scam can not make a correction .
It is in the same way that it is in .
If you want to tell someone that you would never describe a foot inside , you should n't describe the way that your feet will move .
While it does n't sound very wrong , the correct version makes a bit more sense .
I 'm sure a correction to bring a correction on the show .
It 's not a problem - I 'm not sure about it .
If you think about it , this one does not make much sense in terms of it .
It is quite a difficult occurrence .
Instead , if you are looking to impose yourself , then you want to use the original and correct phrase .
I can not give a correction to a correction of a scam .
I am not sure in the backside of the backside .
This one is particularly inappropriate . As it is one 's butt , pinching is an effective way to curb understand undesirable .
The correct phrase for the correct phrase dates , such as `` when a friend sprouts to quashing during a flower . ''
I am not a certain person to provide a correction in the doctor .
I believe it is a call .
The word is spelled to `` It means to call over or request '' .
This one makes sense .
the original one was a bit more sure .
If you are wondering if you are wondering , it is a signal or nod .
I believe a scam can help you with a card and call .
Do you understand ?
If considered after `` beck '' , beck and call .
There are two reasons .
The English language is not always normal .
