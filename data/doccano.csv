407,Companies have long under-appreciated the role of techcomm in their organizations . I believe their role of techcomm in their mind .

413,"It also impedes quality control in other ways , by opening the door to incomplete and inaccurate information , since content often travels directly to the consumer with little oversight along the way .

430,Technical communicators are lending their product expertise through social media . *This is already their product expertise in social media .
431,"Rather than creating content before a product ships , they participate in real-time exchanges with customers who look to social media as a complement to , or even a substitute for , documentation that comes with the product . If a product can be a king or a substitute for a product , it can be a king or a substitute for customers ."

522,"Every day , globalization is changing the content game in a variety of ways . Every day is changing the content game in a variety of ways ."
523,"Here in the US , for example , immigration is expanding the pool of non-native English speakers . Here in the United States for example : immigration is expanding the pool of non-native ."
524,Content also has to reflect the rise of developing markets and their diversified needs and languages . I believe also has to reflect the rise of developing markets and their are languages .
525,"The fact is that the globalization coin has two sides , and companies need to keep both in mind : globalization 's diversifying power is having a huge impact on our workforce ( those who produce content ) and on customers ( those who consume it ) . The fact is that the fact is that the two sides has two sides , and companies need to keep both in mind , those who produce content ."
526,"As the trend toward language diversity grows , we can expect big implications for creating consistent content . As the trend toward language diversity is grows , we can expect a lot for creating it ."
527,"Let 's take a closer look at this phenomenon . Let 's take a closer look at this , understand ."
528,"If you check out census charts tracking immigration in the US over the past 50 years , a few remarkable differences will leap out at you : In 1960 , just under 10 million people in the US were foreign-born , or 5.4 percent of the total population . If you check out census census of census charts . It is in the United States over the US over 1960 years , a few remarkable differences between the United States or even percent of the worlds ."
529,"By 2010 , that number had climbed to 40 million , or 12.9 percent . The phone had climbed to 40 million dollars , or 12.9 ."
530,Immigration routes that mostly began in Europe now originate in Asia and Latin America . It mostly began in Europe now that mostly in Europe originate in Asia .
531,The population of foreign-born US residents now exceeds 5 percent in two-thirds of the 50 states ; in California the proportion is 27 percent . I am not sure of why we can recall 5 percent in two-thirds in two-thirds of the 50 states in California .
532,Over 60 million Americans speak a language other than English in the home . There are over English million million million music .
533,"For content creators , these numbers matter . For content creators , those numbers matter ."
534,"As the US population diversifies , content must do the same . As the United States population , population diversifies , must do the same ."
535,It 's not just that content needs to be culturally attuned to a rapidly evolving US customer base . It is not just that content needs to be entirely culturally culturally .
536,"There 's also the question of making content multilingual , either through translation or by creating content in other languages from scratch . There is also the question of making content , either through translation or creating content in other languages from scratch ."
537,"Adding to this challenge is the fact that many non-native speakers who are producing content are n't professional writers , but rather engineers and support staff . Adding to this challenge is not the fact that many non-native speakers are producing content ."
538,The culture-and-language challenge that content creators face in the US is a smaller version of what 's happening globally . The content of the content that content creators in the United States is a smaller version of what is happening .
539,"As the world gets smaller , it also gets more complicated . The world gets smaller , it gets more complicated ."
540,"It 's important to note that globalization has changed not only where companies do business , but also how . It is important to note that it has changed , not only where companies , but also , how ."
541,Hundreds of case studies and reports document the experience of companies that adapt their products to the specialized needs of local markets . It 's hard to markets the experience of local studies and reports document the experience of local markets .
542,"We 've probably all read , for example , about how McDonald 's has tailored its menus to suit the diets and taste buds of Indian consumers . We have probably read , for example , about how McDonald 's has tailored ."
543,Content is no different . I believe it is no different .
544,"So how user-friendly is your content in the markets where you either currently , or hope to soon , do business ? How can it be your content in the markets where you either currently currently currently exist ?"
545,Translatability : hurdling the barrier More and more companies respond to the globalization challenge of reaching diverse customers by turning to translation . It can be difficult and more companies to respond with the challenge of reaching diverse suggestions .
546,"If you want to connect emotionally with your customers — one of the keys to building relationships with them — then your content needs to speak their language . If you want to connect emotionally with your brain , one of the keys to building relationships with their language ."
547,Many companies that a few years ago translated their content into just one or two languages now translate to more than 20 . A lot of companies that a few years ago translated to their content into their content into 20 .
548,"If international markets matter to you , translation is a must . If international matter is a must ."
549,"And , given the importance of the Internet as the global meeting-place for business , this is true for companies regardless of their scale . If you use the importance of the Internet , this is true for companies , because this is true for companies ."
550,"In some markets , getting translation right is especially important . To sum up is right , getting translation is especially important ."
551,"For example , China will ultimately become the biggest market in the world , with enormous opportunity for growth . For example , China will ultimately become the biggest market in the world with enormous opportunity ."
552,"Without a doubt , content directed at this market must be in Chinese . Without a doubt , content directed at this market must be in Chinese ."
553,"But does that mean Mandarin only , or Cantonese too ? Does that mean it is , or Cantonese too ?"
554,"As anyone who 's traveled or bought a product made overseas knows all too well , translation quality varies wildly . As anyone who is traveled or bought a product made overseas , translation quality is not sufficient ."
555,Content marketers need to take heed . I believe marketers marketers to take it .
556,"Reading a poorly translated product manual can make customers wonder how much a company has thought about its product experience , or even what the content says about the product itself . I even found a poorly content product manual ."
557,"Most importantly , translation quality signals how much a company cares — or does n't — about its customers . It is hard to understand because quality quality signals a company or does not matter ."
558,"As a result , it 's critical to pay attention to the quality of your source content . It is important to pay attention to the quality of your source source ."
559,"Whether a translator is a human or a machine , your company should ensure that it prepares its source content with translatability in mind . Whether a translator is a human or a machine should ensure that it is source ."
560,"For example : Continuously improve your source language by finding better substitutes for terms likely to be unfamiliar or ambiguous to non-native speakers Keep sentence structure short and simple Watch for idiomatic expressions that translate poorly into other languages Yet a lack of resources to get content right compounds the problem of translatability . For example , Continuously : Continuously your source by finding better language by finding better substitutes or to non-native or to non-native ."
561,"While translation can be costly , cutting corners can easily result in low-quality content . While translation can be costly , cut corners can easily result in low-quality content ."
562,Fast-paced product development contributes to this dilemma by introducing rapid changes . It is a dilemma to this dilemma by introducing rapid changes .
563,"Indeed , the trend toward agile development , emphasizing speed and lean resourcing , suggests this is a particularly important aspect of the content-generating process to monitor . Even though they are their favorites , they are the trend toward , agile , agile , and lean resourcing ."
564,"Technical writers may respond to the pressure by sacrificing quality for speed , a particular concern when you consider that all too often no quality control stands between the content creator and the reader . Harvey writers may respond to the pressure by sacrificing quality for speed , a particular particular concern stands for speed ."
565,"Thus , source content itself may suffer , leading to difficulties for translators , and putting important details in jeopardy . I believe , source , source content itself may suffer through difficulties for difficulties ."
566,And details matter . Please details .
567,"If user interface strings are not accurately localized to particular language markets , for example , you may end up confusing translators and ultimately your customers . If user interface strings are not accurately at the same language , you may end up confusing and ultimately you may end up being confusing ."
568,"Some content gurus suggest that the best content is clever and cultural . Some content is clever , but the best content is clever and cultural ."
569,"However , the worst content for translation also happens to be clever and cultural . However , the worst content for translation also happens to be clever and cultural ."
570,How do you achieve a balance in this contradiction that makes quality content accessible to customers and addresses the impact of globalization on a diverse workforce ? How do you achieve a balance in this contradiction ? That makes quality content and addresses the impact of globalization .
571,"In response to this dilemma , and as high-quality source content increasingly becomes a key to translatability , interest in standardization will grow , too . In response to this dilemma , and as and as high-quality , high-quality content becomes a key to understand will grow ."
572,"Every language has parallel grammatical constructions and words to say the same thing . Every language has it already , grammatical to say and words to say the same thing ."
573,"Eventually , companies are likely to find that more standardized approaches to content will help them leap the translation barrier with greater efficiency . It 's possible that it is likely to find that more exciting approaches to content the translation ."
574,"Few aspects of doing business today matter as much as building strong relationships with your customers wherever they happen to live . A few aspects of doing business today matter as long as building relationships , they happen to live ."
575,"Content is your passport for getting there , so make sure that you give it the justice that it deserves . It deserves you for getting there , so make sure you give it the justice it deserves ."

Not only that , last year nine out of ten B2B out of ten B2B this year marketers that will undoubtedly continue ."
581,"As a result of all of this activity , we are bombarded with more content than we could ever begin to consume . As a result of all , we are bombarded with more content than we could ever begin to consume ."
582,"And , since a lot of that content is boring , confusing , self-serving , or inarticulate , we have become adept at making instant decisions about what content we 'll consume and what we 'll delete or ignore . And since a lot of that content is boring , I can guess , or inarticulate , we have become adept at making instant decisions ."

As the process reflecting growth growth growth , the competition of using the process of using the competition is increasing ."
585,This presents a challenge because your content needs to stand out from all the noise . This presents a challenge because your content should be running out from all the noise .
586,"As Jake Sorofman , research director at Gartner , warned last year , `` audiences are inundated by pleas for their attention and consumers no longer respond to anything but the most compelling content . '' Do n't respond to anything but research at Gartner , warned Sorofman , at Gartner ."

Certainly you need to generate content that responds to customers the real needs of actionable , and does all that in as short as possible ."

592,"Your content wo n't get far without readers , so you have to ensure that your content is findable . Your content will not get far without readers . So you have to ensure your content is findable ."
593,"That means making sure that search engines understand what your content is about by utilizing the right keywords ( particularly multi-word phrases known as long-tail keywords ) in the appropriate places in your content , such as the headlines , the first sentence or two of the body , and the metadata .

595,"Once your readers have found your content , it must be readable . Once your readers have found your content , it must be readable ."
596,"There are several ways to measure content readability , including how concisely it 's written , its scanability , and its objectivity . Even though there are several ways to measure content , it is scanability ."
597,"Online content should be at least 50 percent leaner than its print version . The least content should be at 50 percent , 50 percent leaner than it is print ."
598,"Staying concise also helps readers scan your content , with simple sentences and bite-size chunks of straightforward text to guide their eyes up , down , across , and diagonally . Please stay able to gain some helpful details to your content , scan your content , and diagonally ."
599,Objectivity reassures readers that your content provides relevant information rather than promoting your brand . I believe readers that your content provides information rather than promoting your brand .
600,All three elements matter . This is all three to assume .
601,"A classic study by John Morkes and Jakob Nielsen discovered that concise writing increased usability by 58 percent ; making content scanable improved usability by 47 percent ; and delivering objective content improved usability by 27 percent .

1048,The important point is that this widely accepted view will soon get turned on its head . The important point is that this widely accepted will be relocated .
1049,Let us explain . Let us explain the answer .
1050,"Most people view content marketing as revolving around blogs posts , videos , and infographics – in short , all the usual suspects in terms of marketing content . Many people believe content content as revolving ."
1051,"They rarely if ever consider all of the other types of content that companies create — technical manuals , product data sheets , and customer service FAQs to cite a few examples — and how all of it could align with and support their efforts . The examples rarely consider a few examples of content with a few examples of content and support service ."
1052,"Similarly , most marketing teams never engage their peers in other departments about their content marketing activities unless it 's to ask them to serve as subject matter experts for a particular project . It is difficult to ask them for a particular project unless it is to ask them to serve a particular project ."
1053,"Regardless of whether that 's due to a lack of time or interest , they also do n't go out of their way to understand what content other departments are creating , let alone try to corral those efforts or align them . It does not matter whether that is due to a lack of time or interest to understand what 's content ."
1054,"As a result , it 's easy for silos to form and for other departments to create content without regard for corporate standards . It is easy to create content in order to create content without corporate standards ."
1055,And who can blame them ? Who can blame them ?
1056,They have their own goals to meet and adhering to the marketing team 's guidelines is rarely one of them . They have their own goals to meet and adhering to the marketing team 's guidelines .
1057,"This lack of coordination can lead to two big missed opportunities : First , for content marketers who cite an inability to consistently produce enough content to meet demand among their top challenges , [ 1 ] tapping into all of the customer-facing content that other teams already create offers a possible solution . The lack of coordination can lead to two big challenges and First for content demand ."
1058,"If marketers could find a way to take advantage of non-marketing content , they 'd likely discover that they had more than enough content . If you can find a way to take advantage of non-marketing , they would likely discover that they had more content ."
1059,"In fact , their real challenge would n't be publishing enough content ; it would be figuring out how to utilize that content and align it with marketing standards . In fact , their real challenge would not be enough enough , it would be figuring out how to utilize how to utilize it with marketing standards ."
1060,Even more important is the missed opportunity to create a superior customer experience . This is even more important is the missed opportunity to create a superior customer .
1061,"The fact that in most companies , multiple departments publish customer-facing content means that inconsistencies in many areas will inevitably occur , such as in readability , tone of voice , use of brand names and jargon , and even grammar and spelling . The fact that in most companies , multiple departments means that inconsistencies means that inconsistencies in many areas , tone of voice , and brand ."
1062,"As a result , instead of creating a better overall experience for their customers , these companies are at risk of confusing them . In my opinion , instead of creating a better overall experience for their opinions , these companies are confusing of confusing people ."
1063,"Imagine , for example , a company that uses four different terms interchangeably to mean the same thing . For example , a company that uses four different terms interchangeably to mean the same thing ."
1064,That `` creativity '' in the use of terminology can confuse and alienate customers . This `` in the use of terminology '' can confuse and understand .
1065,"After all , sloppiness and inconsistency do n't exactly inspire confidence or trust . After all , you can not inspire or trust ."
1066,"Allowing two big opportunities like these to get away wo n't be good enough in the future . It can be used two big opportunities like these to get away , but wo n't be good enough in the future ."
1067,"Instead , as content marketing continues to evolve and mature , it must become a discipline that transcends multiple departments . As , as content continues to evolve , and mature , it must become a discipline that transcends ."
1068,"Some companies have already started to recognize that all of the customer-facing content they create has a role in moving customers down the path to purchase , regardless of where it comes from , and that in fact much of it is just as important or even more important than the material that marketing produces . Some companies have already started to recognize that all of the customer-facing they create , regardless of where it comes from , and that is just as important or more important than the path ."
1069,"It 's only a matter of time before content marketers realize that they must partner closely with their counterparts in other departments such as technical documentation , customer service , and product development . It 's only a matter of time before content , though marketers marketers that they must partner in other departments , and product development , customer service ."
1070,"Plus , they 'll discover that they need to bring the content that their entire organization creates into the fold of their content marketing program . In addition , they will discover that they need to bring the content that their entire organization creates the fold of their content marketing ."
1071,"For those reasons , companies will begin to bring together the disparate teams that create customer-facing content today . For those reasons , companies will begin to bring together the disparate of teams ."
1072,"Members of the marketing team , for example , may find themselves merging with their peers in tech docs and customer service with the goal of creating a single content engine to fuel a unified customer experience from start to finish . It 's the goal of the marketing team to finish a single customer from the beginning of creating a single content from the beginning ."
1073,Smart companies are already blazing ahead in this direction . Smart companies are already ahead in this direction .
1074,"Importantly , even though content marketing will no longer solely focus on marketing content , marketing 's role will not diminish . Even though content marketing marketing does not work focus on marketing content , it does not work out focus on marketing marketing ."
1075,"On the contrary , it will become more important than ever as marketing evolves to become a centralized hub for overseeing — or at least influencing — the creation of all customer-facing content company-wide in partnership with other departments . It will become more important in the contrary , it will become more important than ever as marketing as marketing , at least influencing ."
1076,"While few organizations today present unified content to their customers , the situation will change in the months and years ahead . Almost today is today 's content but the situation will change in the months and years ahead ."

3237,"You 'll get better results and wo n't have to create nearly as much content to do so . You will get better results , and wo n't have to create nearly as much content to do so ."
3238,That 's a win-win in my book . That is a separate in my book .
3239,"Editor 's Note : This post is based off of a presentation that Val Swisher , CEO of Content Rules , recently gave at Content Connections , Acrolinx 's online , virtual conference . I Content Connections is based off of a presentation that Val Swisher ."
3240,"Held in November 2015 , the event attracted more than 2,000 content professionals from around the world . Even though in November 2015 , the event is attracted to November 2015 ; the event is attracted to the world ."
3241,Content optimization is about making sure that your content is performing at its best . I believe it is about making sure that your content is performing at the best .
3242,"At a time when content is more important than ever before — and companies are creating more of it , often in multiple languages — ensuring that it 's optimized is essential . At a time when content is more important than ever before , — is more important than ever before — ."
3243,"That 's because when you optimize your content you can increase its quality and consistency , while decreasing the costs associated with creating it . That is because when you optimize your content , you can increase it and consistency on the quality associated with creating it ."
3244,"Not only that , you can improve your time-to-market . Not only that , you can improve your mind ."
3245,"All of that is true whether we 're talking about marketing content , technical content , or both . That is true whether we are talking about marketing content , technical content , or both ."
3246,It 's also true whether you 're dealing with just a single source language or a source language and translations . It is also true whether you are dealing with just a single source of single language or a source .
3247,"In my experience , there are four stages that companies go through as they become more experienced at content optimization . In my experience , there are four stages that companies go through as they become more experienced at content ."
3248,"Together , those four stages make up the content optimization maturity model that you see below : Let 's break that maturity model down and talk about what it means to crawl , walk , run , and ultimately dance . The four stages make the content optimization from the content to crawl , walk , and ultimately dance ."
3249,"Crawling When you 're crawling your content is n't optimized , at least not in any formalized sense . `` You 're crawling your content '' is not optimized ."
3250,Any optimization that does occur happens by way of tribal knowledge . It is possible that that does occur by way of tribal knowledge .
3251,"Everyone sort of knows the rules and , should any doubt arise , you 'll see people whispering over cubicle walls , each weighing in on what the best course of action might be . Everyone sort of knows the rules , and should any doubt arise , you will see people whispering , each weighing in on what the best course of action might be ."
3252,They may even do peer reviews of each other 's work from time to time . They may even do peer reviews of each other work from time to time .

3259,It 's bad news all around because crawling just does n't work as an optimization strategy . It 's bad news all around because crawling just does n't work .
3260,Walking Most of the companies I work with come to me when they 're at this stage . A walk out of the companies I work with .
3261,"When you 're walking , you 've gotten a bit better because by now your styles and brand preferences are documented . When you are walking , you have gotten better because by now your styles and brand preferences are documented ."

3263,"Importantly , since it 's documented , all of this information is no longer merely tribal knowledge that lives in a handful of people 's heads . Since it is documented , all of this information is no longer available in a handful of people 's heads ."
3264,"The problem , however , is that since you 're using rudimentary tools like Word and Excel to capture all of this information , people have to actively pull it when they need it ( usually from a PDF on a server somewhere ) , which they never do . The problem is that since you are using it , it is since since you are using it tools , such as Word and Loving all of this information , which never do ."
3265,The hard truth is that no one ever reads or consults your guidelines because they just do n't have the time . The hard truth is that no one ever reads or something because they do not have the time .
3266,"And , even worse , you 've got no way to enforce it . You have no way to enforce it ."
3267,"As a result , when you reach the point where you 're walking , you 'll soon discover that you 're probably walking in circles . As a result , when you reach the point where you are walking , you will soon discover that you are walking in circles ."
3268,"You 've invested a lot of time and money to get where you are , with people working to create your documented guidelines , but they never get used . You have invested time and money to get where you are , with people working to create your thoughts , but they never get used ."
3269,"And , since they rarely if ever get updated , they 're often outdated . Since they rarely get updated , they are often outdated ."
3270,"The bottom line is that despite having invested time and money , you effectively still have all the same problems you had when you were crawling . The bottom line is that despite time and money , you still effectively have the same problems you had when you were crawling ."
3271,Running This is where you want to be . I am keeping this .
3272,"When you 're running , you 're actually using powerful tools , which allow you to start enforcing your style and terminology programmatically . When you are running , you are actually using powerful tools , which allow you to start enforcing ."
3273,"Rather than have a style guide in a PDF that people have to pull from , you instead use a tool that pushes that style and terminology out to your content creators . You should use a tool that is creators and like a tool that is creators in a PDF that people have to pull a tool ."
3274,"That allows you to easily enforce style , terminology , and tone of voice preferences across your entire enterprise . This allows you to easily enforce , terminology , and tone of voice preferences ."
3275,The great thing about running is that you can create optimized content at scale because you can push all of these guidelines out to content creators no matter where they sit in your organization . The great thing about running is that you can create content at scale because you can push all of these guidelines .
3276,And that 's when you start reaping the benefits . That is when you start it reaping .
3277,"You 'll have better , higher-quality content . You will have better , but it higher-quality ."
3278,"You 'll decrease time-to-market and translation costs . You will decrease it , and it is costly ."
3279,And you 'll ensure greater brand consistency and cohesion . You will ensure greater brand and not can occur .

3281,"Dancing The last step is dancing , which I like to think of as the missing piece in the content optimization pyramid . The last step is dancing , which I like to think about as the missing piece of as the missing optimization in the content ."
3282,It 's also relatively new since it 's really only in the past few months that the technology has existed to make dancing with our content possible . It is possible since it is only in the past few months that the technology has existed with our content possible .
3283,So what do I mean by dancing ? What do I mean by dancing ?
3284,It 's when the terms and segments in your content match what 's in your translation memory . It is when the terms and it can be found in your translation match .
3285,Let me explain . Let me explain the situation .
3286,Big companies that create content in lots of different languages usually have a translation memory — a database that stores your source content and any corresponding translations . Paying your content in lots of different languages usually have a database memory .
3287,"Every time you send a new piece of content to be translated , it 's checked against the database to see if any of it — individual words and terms , whole phrases , etc. , — have already been translated before and are therefore stored in your translation memory . Every time you send a new piece of content to be translated , it 's checked against the database to see if any of the words are any individual words ."
3288,"If there are any , they 're pulled out and reused , saving time and reducing translation costs considerably . If there are any pulled out and reused and reused , considerably ."
3289,"When you 're dancing , you 're marrying what 's been translated upstream to what your content creators are doing downstream . Think about it when you are dancing , you are marrying what has been translated , but what your content are doing ."
3290,"Effectively , you 're trying to integrate your translation memory with your writing so that when you send your new content out to be translated , you know that much of it can be pulled from your translation memory . It can be pulled from your translation with your writing memory if you send your new content to be translated ."
3291,"To do this you need the right tools , including a database to house your translation memory and yet another system that actively pushes terminology to content creators . To do this you need the right tools , including a database to database memory , your translation , and yet another system that does n't make sense ."
3292,"For any company that 's creating content in multiple languages , dancing should really be the end goal of content optimization . In multiple languages that dancing content , dancing should be the end of content ."
3293,"That way , not only is your English content optimized , but also all of your translations . This way , not only is your English content , but also all of your mind ."
3294,"Making Your Way Through the Content Optimization Maturity Model Each level of the content optimization maturity model is more complex than the one before it . Even maturity from the content of the content , it is more complex than Model ."
3295,"Going from one to the next takes greater and greater investments in time and money . Going from one to the next takes greater and greater , investments ."
3296,"Nevertheless , you 'll find that the results you get from doing so — better content , cheaper translations , faster time-to-market — are more than worth the effort . I understand , you 'll find that the results you get from doing so better content , faster time-to-market ."

It seems as though greater sales can be tactics on greater sales and greater sales to communicating ."
3317,"We absolutely agree , though we respectfully point out that there 's a broader view to be taken here . We agree , though we respectfully that there is a possibility to be taken here ."

3319,"That includes content from other teams such as techdocs , product , customer service , and sales . That includes content from other teams such as techdocs , product , and sales ."

3329,"Held in November 2015 , the event attracted more than 2,000 content professionals from around the world . Even though in November 2015 , the event is attracted to November 2015 ; the event is attracted to the world ."
3330,I 'm a big believer in the importance of creating quality content . I am a big fan of creating quality quality .
3331,But sometimes I wonder if that belief is at odds with the basic need so many marketers have for quantity . Sometimes I wonder if that is the odds at the odds with the basic need .
3332,"After all , no matter how good your content is , you usually need a lot of it to generate leads and fill your pipeline . After all , no matter how good your content is , you usually need a lot of it to understand and fill your understand ."
3333,"The problem , of course , is that when you hit the gas on content creation , the quality usually takes a nosedive as a result . If you hit the gas on content creation , the quality usually takes a nosedive on content ."
3334,But does that mean that quality and quantity are mutually exclusive ? Does that mean quality and quantity are mutually exclusive ?
3335,Of course not . Of course not .
3336,They can absolutely coexist . They can absolutely coexist .
3337,"And good content can scale , provided that you 've got the basics right . And good content can scale the medication right ."
3338,"I 'm talking about things like being bigger , braver , and bolder — three points that I 'll explain in more detail in just a minute . I am talking about things like being bigger , braver , and bolder — ."

3340,"At a time when there 's so much content and noise , playing it safe makes it really difficult to cut through and stand out . At a time , when there is so much content and noise , playing it safe makes it really difficult to cut through and stand out ."
3341,And standing out is exactly what you need to do . High out is what you need to do .
3342,"That does n't mean creating more content ( though you will need a lot of it ) , but rather creating better content that people find engaging and actually want . That does not mean creating more content though , you will need a lot of it , but rather creating better content that people find engaging ."
3343,"And that means striving to be bigger , braver , and bolder . The means that striving to be bigger , braver , and bolder ."

3346,"To make yours bigger , you have to put your product or service into the context of the lives of the people you 're serving . To make yours bigger , you have to put your product or service into the lives of the people you are serving ."
3347,"Remember it 's not about you , it 's about what you do for others and why they should do business with you . Remember , it is not about you , it is about what you do for others and why they should do business with you ."
3348,"The most effective way to do this is to think about how you can use your story to convert people to your tribe , so that they become interested in you and what you 're all about .

3349,One company that does this really well is Blue Bottle Coffee . One company that has a lot of money .
3350,"Although I was familiar with their brand , what piqued my interest about these California-based coffee makers was that they had produced an online course on Skillshare about how to create an amazing cup of coffee .

3369,"Rather than focus on how great Slack is ( and if you have n't used it yet , trust me it is ) , the podcast covers a mix of business stories that are all about making work less worky . If you have not used it yet , it is about making work a like a king or a similar podcast ."
3370,"It 's both serious and fun , kind of like `` This American Life '' meets `` The Office , '' which is why I think it 's bold and brave . It 's bold and fun , kind of like `` This American Life '' meets `` The Office , '' which is bold and brave ."

3372,The first is the importance of refining your point of view over time . The first is the important thing to understand over time .
3373,"Slack has taken an iterative approach to its podcast , changing it up based both on listenership as well as the input that the producers get from an internal feedback loop . It has taken an internal feedback to the podcast , and changing it based on both the producers ."
3374,That means they 're constantly improving the show . They mean they 're constantly the show .
3375,The other great idea you should take from them is that they produce two versions of every show . The other great idea you should take from them is that they produce two versions of every show .
3376,"One is a half-hour version that gives the full program , while the other is a series of shorter segments sliced up from the original . One is a half-hour version that gives the full program while the other is a series of shorter segments ."
3377,"This is really smart because the shorter version , called `` Slack Single Serves , '' is much better suited to sharing for those people who do n't have time to listen to the full program . This is really smart because the shorter version is much better suited for those who do not have time to listen to the full program ."
3378,So be brave and try new things . Be brave and try new things .
